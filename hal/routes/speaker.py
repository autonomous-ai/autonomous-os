"""FastAPI router for speaker (voice-identity) recognition.

Routes accept local WAV filepaths only (no base64 — keeps the HTTP surface
minimal; internally the service handles both). Mounted by
:mod:`hal.server` on application startup.

Enrolled users live under ``/speaker/*``; unknown-voice-cluster browsing
lives under ``/voice/*`` (input side — avoids semantic clash with the
loudspeaker hardware). Both sets live in this file since they're two
halves of the same speaker recognition surface.

Routes:
    POST   /speaker/enroll                       — enroll / re-enroll a user from WAV paths
    POST   /speaker/identity                     — attach Telegram identity to existing profile
    POST   /speaker/reset                        — wipe all voice profiles
    POST   /speaker/remove                       — delete a user's voice folder
    POST   /speaker/recognize                    — identify the speaker of a WAV file
    GET    /speaker/list                         — list users with registered voice
    GET    /voice/strangers                      — list unknown-voice clusters + samples
    GET    /voice/strangers/audio/{hash}/{file}  — stream a cluster sample WAV
