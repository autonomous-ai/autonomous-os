"""Voice metrics measurement — observations only, no behaviour change.

Two questions, measured on the device because HAL is the only process that
knows when audio actually reached the speaker:

  the response metric  Was the user's voice command acknowledged within
         ``ACK_DEADLINE_MS`` of the detected end of their speech?
  the stale-reply metric  Did an outdated reply actually get played after a suppression
         boundary (an explicit stop, or the realtime agent answering a newer
         question)?

Both targets (3 s / ≥95 % / <1 %) are **provisional**: every raw duration is
stored, so thresholds can be re-decided from the data instead of by
re-instrumenting devices.

Design rules that decide whether a number is trustworthy:

* **Playback, not acceptance.** The ack signal is the first frame actually
  written to the audio stream (``TTSService._note_audio_written``), never an
  HTTP 200, a queued sentence, model output, or ``on_speak_start`` — the
  cached path fires that one *before* taking the stream lock, so speech that
  is stopped or fails before its first write would look played. Even the first
  write is not the acoustic onset: ALSA/Bluetooth buffering sits after it.
* **Explicit ownership.** Every playback carries the owner that claimed the
  speaker (``run:<turn_id>`` or ``interaction:<id>``). Audio with **no** owner
  is recorded as ``unknown`` and never counted as an acknowledgement — a
  guess is how an old filler gets credited to a new command.
* **Monotonic, one process.** Every elapsed time is a difference of two
  ``time.monotonic()`` reads inside HAL. os-server's clock is never
  subtracted from HAL's.
* **A detected endpoint, not the acoustic truth.** ``speech_end_method``
  records how the endpoint was decided, and the clock starts at that
  detection — before transcript assembly, not after it.
* **Incomplete is not success.** A suppression whose window closes while the
  suppressed turns are still alive reports ``observation_complete = false``,
  not "no stale reply".
