"""LOOK-DEBUG: per-look trace dirs for the aim -> capture -> answer flow.

Modelled on the SPEAKER-DEBUG tracer in
`hal/drivers/voice/speaker_recognizer/speaker_recognizer.py` — same shape, same
guarantees: OFF by default, self-contained, and it never raises. A tracing bug
must not cost the user an answer.

Why it exists: the flow spans three modules and two services, so when a visual
question goes wrong ("it captured the ceiling", "it said it couldn't see") there
is no single place that shows what actually happened. This puts the trigger, the
aim decision, the exact frame that was sent, the question and the spoken answer
in one directory per look.

Env knobs (all optional):
  HAL_LOOK_DEBUG              "true" to enable (OFF by default)
  HAL_LOOK_DEBUG_DIR          output root (default: ./look_logs next to this file)
  HAL_LOOK_DEBUG_MAX_ENTRIES  dir cap, oldest pruned (default 200; 0 = unbounded)

Layout — one dir per look, named so failures are greppable at a glance:
  <root>/<ts>_OK_centred/            aim reached centre
  <root>/<ts>_OK_deadline/           captured, but the aim ran out of time
  <root>/<ts>_FAIL-no_subject/       nothing found to aim at
  <root>/<ts>_FAIL-no_camera/        ...
each holding:
  capture.jpg   the exact frame handed to the model (absent if capture failed)
  result.json   trigger, aim metrics, question, answer, and any error

The trace spans two modules because the answer is not known when the frame is
taken: the orchestrator opens it at the `look` call, turn_dispatch closes it once
the turn has an answer. State is module-level for the same reason
`realtime_look_frame_path` is — one look is in flight at a time.
