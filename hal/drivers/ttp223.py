"""TTP223 capacitive touchpad handler (dog-head touch surface).

How many pads and which lines is board data, not a constant here — see the
`touch` entry in hal/board/boards.json. It has changed twice (the pads were
relocated to escape LED/servo/audio coupling), so any count written into this
docstring goes stale; ask the board profile.

Destructive gestures (reboot / shutdown) are intentionally OFF on TTP223
because the IC on this board runs in FastMode: output drops LOW within
~50ms of touch even with finger still on the pad, so a true "hold 5s"
is impossible without rewiring the FM pin. GPIO button still owns those.

LAYER 1 — SESSION. Any edge, either direction, any pad, restarts a 200ms timer.
When it lapses the "contact" ends. This coalesces the burst of cross-talk and
FastMode auto-release edges that one finger produces. A contact is one touch of
the surface — but NOT one gesture: a continuous stroke never lets the timer
lapse, so a whole 1s pet arrives as a single contact, and two fast taps arrive
as one contact too. Everything below was written after learning that on device.

LAYER 2 — GESTURE. On by default (SWIPE_ENABLED); HAL_TOUCH_SWIPE=false makes the driver
resolve only tap and count-based pet, exactly as it always did.

The signal is WHEN pads fire, not which. Device-measured on orange-lamp
2026-08-27, inter-pad gaps inside one contact:

    fingers landing together    1 .. 23 ms
    a finger travelling        53 .. 322 ms

Nothing in between, and SWIPE_MIN_GAP_MS sits in the gap. From that one
threshold everything else follows:

  SWIPE       one contact, every pad, monotonic along the axis, gaps above the
              floor. One contact only — each leg of a back-and-forth stroke is
              itself a clean pass, so allowing any leg to carry the verdict
              turns every pet into a swipe.
  DOUBLE TAP  two or more tight multi-pad BURSTS overlapping in place. Fast taps
              share a contact; slow taps arrive as separate contacts. Checked
              before pet, because the second tap re-touches the same pads.
  PET         the finger revisited a pad it had left (more steps than distinct
              pads), or contacts landed in different places. A stroke's steps are
              evenly spread, so it has no bursts to be mistaken for taps.
  TAP         anything else, including several fingers landing at once — that
              lights every pad but within ~20ms, which is not movement.

Two parts of the tap action escape the decision wait, both at the FIRST contact
end of a burst (~0.2s after the finger lifts): in-flight TTS is stopped
immediately, and a short ack chime plays — stop latency and "did it hear me"
feedback are the parts of the gesture users actually feel. Deliberate semantic
change that comes with it: petting her head while she talks now cuts her off
(the pet giggle follows) — touch means "attention here" either way. Only TTS is
cut early; music keeps playing until the burst actually resolves as a tap, so
petting during music never kills the playlist. Unmute + the listening cue also
still wait for resolution.

        TAP is the fall-through after swipe, double tap and pet all decline, so
        a reason describing how it got here ("decision window expired at
        count=1") is true and useless: it is the one verdict where the reader
        most needs to know what was *nearly* matched. A swipe missing the
        movement floor by 1.1 ms read exactly the same as a deliberate tap
        (device traces 102922 / 102935, 2026-08-28), and the only way to tell
        was to open the file and know what `moved: False` implied.

        Names the nearest miss and the number to tune, so the answer is in the
        trace rather than in someone's head.
