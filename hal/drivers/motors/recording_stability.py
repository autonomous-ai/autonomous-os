"""Whole-body stability gate for servo recordings — the tip-over check.

Speed is already bounded (``recording_timing``) and each joint is individually
inside its range, yet a recording can still put a body on its side: what tips it
is the COMBINATION of joint angles, which no per-joint bound can express.

Measured 2026-09-04 on lamp-0c89 (issue #271). A third-party CSV whose every
joint sat inside its declared range tipped the unit over. Reconstructing the
centre of gravity for that clip and for all 29 shipped lamp recordings separates
them cleanly: the clip that tipped peaked at 31.6 mm off the base axis, the
worst shipped recording at 17.7 mm, the other 28 at or below 17.6 mm.

Nothing here knows which robot it is running on. The geometry comes from the
body's own URDF (``ROBOT.md`` ``urdf_ref``) and the ceiling from its own
``SAFETY.md`` (``motion.max_cog_offset_mm``); both are per-body declarations,
and a body that ships neither is simply not gated — presence-driven, like every
other bound in ``robots/contract/SAFETY-SPEC.md``.

Deriving the ceiling for a new body: score its own animation library, take the
widest, add headroom. Never copy another robot's number — it is millimetres of
that body's geometry and mass, not a universal constant.
