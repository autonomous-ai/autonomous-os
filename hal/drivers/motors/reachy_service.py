"""Reachy Mini motion driver — wraps Pollen's `reachy_mini` SDK.

Satisfies the MotionService protocol (hal/drivers/motors/base.py) so
routes/servo.py works unchanged on Reachy Mini.

Architecture: Pollen ships a daemon on the robot's Pi that owns hardware I/O,
safety clamping, and the control loop; this driver is a thin client streaming
targets to it (REST/WS on localhost:8000). Unlike the feetech backend there is
no client-side per-frame animation event loop — the daemon holds poses by
itself, so several protocol methods (ensure_running, freeze) reduce to
flags/no-ops. The one exception is music: the play thread repeats the groove
move until music_stop, mirroring the feetech backend (see _play_recording).

Joint model exposed to HAL (degrees + millimeters, matching the deg-based
safety policy and route error checks; the SDK itself speaks radians + meters):

    head_x.pos / head_y.pos / head_z.pos      head translation, mm
    head_roll.pos / head_pitch.pos / head_yaw.pos   head rotation, deg
    body_yaw.pos                              body rotation, deg
    antenna_left.pos / antenna_right.pos      antennas, deg

DRAFT: written against the public reachy-mini SDK docs (v1.9) before hardware
arrival. Everything tagged TODO(spike) must be verified on the real robot.

        This is the only place the declared ceiling can be applied on this
        backend. `play_move()` hands the whole trajectory to the Pollen daemon,
        which streams it without HAL in the loop, so there is no frame to slow
        down mid-move the way the feetech driver stretches a recording
        (recording_timing.stretch_timeline). The choice is play or do not play,
        and it has to be made before the trajectory is handed over (#286).

        Refusing matters once a move can come from a stranger's Hub dataset
        (#287); the shipped library is measured and passes at the declared
        ceiling. Applied to every source, deliberately: an official move that
        trips the gate is evidence the declared number is wrong, and excusing
        it by origin would hide exactly that signal.
