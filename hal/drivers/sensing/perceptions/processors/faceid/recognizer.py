        ``crop`` is the BGR face crop to persist; if it is None/empty the view is
        not added, keeping memory and disk in lock-step (every in-memory extended
        embedding has a backing file).

        IMPORTANT: this runs on the ``detect`` hot path, so it NEVER holds
        ``self._lock`` across disk I/O. The lock is taken only for two short,
        pure-memory critical sections (snapshot the existing views; append +
        prune the arrays); the JPEG/sidecar write and any eviction ``unlink``s
        happen with the lock released. Holding the lock across ``cv2.imwrite`` /

        momentarily score ``_NO_MATCH``.

        exceeds ``diversity_threshold`` (default 0.7) the view is a near-
        duplicate of one we already have -> skip. Otherwise it shows a pose the
        set lacks (e.g. a ~0.35 side-view that only just cleared the confidence
