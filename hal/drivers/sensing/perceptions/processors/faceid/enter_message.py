"""presence.enter text — the one place its wording is decided and parsed.

Three consumers read this string and must agree on its shape: the agent
(skills/sensing/SKILL.md greets from it), the wake-focus gate in
sensing_service (``has_new_friend``) and people grepping the flow log
(skills/sensing-track). The ``friend (<name>)`` / ``stranger (<id>)`` labels
for NEW arrivals are that contract and stay byte-identical.

Shape (#426):

    Person detected — new: stranger (stranger_2); already present: momo (friend); faces in frame: 2 (momo, stranger_2)

- ``new:`` — who just became visible, friend part first. This is what
  presence.enter has always meant: NEWLY visible, not visible.
- ``already present:`` — friends boxed in the SAME frame whose last_seen was
  still inside the forget window. It is the co-presence signal the sensing
  skill keys its "looks like you've got company" aside on, so the caller
  guards it (FacePerception._copresence_ticks) and passes an empty list when
  the guard fails. Written ``<name> (friend)`` on purpose: ``friend (<name>)``
  means "a friend just arrived" to ``has_new_friend`` and would open the
  voice gate for a stranger's arrival.
- ``faces in frame:`` — the number of boxes in the frame the snapshot
  shows and their labels in detection order, ``unsure`` for a box without
  an identity yet. Same labels ``_annotate_frame`` draws. It is not the
  number of arrivals: flushed stranger ids may come from several buffered
  frames; the count and ``already present:`` describe the newest one, the
  frame the agent is looking at (``FrameFacts``).

    and the text said ``1 (unsure)`` over a two-box picture). So the facts
