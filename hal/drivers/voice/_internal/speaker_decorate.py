"""Post-STT transcript decoration.

Wraps three closely-related concerns that all run after STT produces a final
transcript:

  1. Wake-word resolution    — strip "hey <name>" prefix, classify event type
  2. Speaker identification  — prefix "<Name>: " from voice embedding
  3. Speech-emotion submit   — async SER call on the full mic session

All speaker-recog + SER state lives here so VoiceService doesn't carry it.
