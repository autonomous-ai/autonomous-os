"""
Voice Service — local VAD + pluggable STT for autonomous sensing.

Pipeline:
  1. Mic always on, local RMS energy check (free, zero cost)
  2. Speech detected → create STT session, stream audio
  3. Silence candidate → provisional turn detection → close session
  4. Transcripts → POST to OS server /api/sensing/event
  5. OS server → local intent match or OpenClaw → AI responds → POST /voice/speak

STT provider is pluggable (default: Deepgram).

Helpers live in `_internal/` — config constants, audio I/O, VAD filters,
speaker decoration, and OS server event sender.

            one was heard, or inside the follow-up window a wake word, a click
            or a gaze opened. Everything that CLAIMS to be the addressee — the
            listening cue, the backchannel — has to ask this first, or the lamp
            answers conversations it was never part of.

            The focus window is re-read LIVE here, not taken from the
            session-start latch, because gaze can open it in the MIDDLE of the
            very sentence it is meant to acknowledge. Device-observed
            04/09/2026 on lamp-0c89: at speech start the camera had no face
            evidence yet ("of 0" samples), so the latch was False; the watcher
            confirmed the user 3.6s later, at speech END, and granted focus
            then. The turn had therefore run with no listening cue at all — the
            device sat dark through the whole sentence and only lit up for the
            NEXT one. Asking live lights the strip the moment the evidence
            arrives, which is exactly when the user starts wondering whether it
            heard them.

            This can only ADD turns that count as addressed, never remove one:
            the latch stays authoritative for dispatch, so a window that
            EXPIRES mid-sentence still cannot cut off someone already speaking
            (that is what the latch exists for).
