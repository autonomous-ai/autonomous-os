"""D: removing an enrollment must not be a half-delete.

os-server retires a person from every runtime's USER.md once their enrollment
directory is gone, but that check runs at startup. Without a poke from HAL, a
person removed from the UI keeps their profile in the agent's system prompt
until the next reboot.
