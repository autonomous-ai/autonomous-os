"""The addressee rule: who may the lamp answer, and what may it say back.

A backchannel ("Right", "Uhm") is the device claiming to be the addressee. It
predates the wake gate — added Apr 2026 to fire on every STT partial — and kept
firing on every utterance after that gate arrived, so the lamp murmured at
conversations between two other people. It also made testing the openers
misleading: the cue sounds like acknowledgement while the turn is dropped
unheard.

The rule is exercised here as the standalone predicate the code uses, so both
callers (listening cue and backchannel) are covered by one statement of it.
