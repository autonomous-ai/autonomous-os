"""The playback-tracking hook on TTSService.

Two things these pin down:

* `on_speak_start` is NOT proof of playback — the cached path fires it before
  it has taken the stream lock or written a byte. The hook must key off the
  first frame that actually reaches the stream.
* There is exactly ONE measuring point, inside the stream wrapper every
  playback writes through. A new playback path cannot escape the metrics by
  forgetting to call anything.
