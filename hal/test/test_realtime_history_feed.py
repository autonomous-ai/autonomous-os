"""A reply the user never heard still has to reach the realtime agent.

os-server drops a cancelled turn's speech before it reaches TTS, and the normal
history feed rides on TTS completion — so without a speaker-free path the
realtime session keeps save_main_handoff's "its spoken reply follows"
placeholder and never learns the answer.
