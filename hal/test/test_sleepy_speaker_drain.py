"""The going-to-sleep line must survive sleepy muting the speaker.

os-server fires `[HW:/emotion:sleepy]` and only waits 100ms before POSTing the
reply text to TTS, and HAL needs roughly as long to reach
_finalize_sleepy_peripherals — so muting the speaker there raced the
announcement and usually won (measured on lamp-0c89 2026-09-14: 3 of 4 runs
answered `suppressed -- speaker muted`). The drain removes the race.
