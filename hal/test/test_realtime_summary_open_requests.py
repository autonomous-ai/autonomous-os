"""The realtime summary's pending tasks must expire (issues #419 / #421).

Expiry is per bullet, keyed on the `[<ISO-8601>]` stamp the summariser writes
at the head of each open request. summary.md is rewritten on every session
that has new entries, so its mtime never gets old on an active device; a
stamp-less bullet falls back to that file age, but a stamped one must not.
