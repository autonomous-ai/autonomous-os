"""Regression tests for retrying a music stream that dies right after starting.

A 403 on the YouTube media URL leaves yt-dlp with nothing to pipe, but ffmpeg
limps along on the partial buffer: it survives the start probe and only exits a
second or two later. That is still a startup failure and must be retried — it
used to be misread as a track that ended on its own.
