"""The blur gate drops frames too smeared to carry an identity.

A blurred face is not a smaller or clipped face, so the height and truncation
gates never see it. What it produces is a near-random embedding that resembles
nothing — and "resembles nothing" is the new-stranger branch, so a blurred frame
of the enrolled user mints a `stranger_N` for him. These tests pin the two
properties that matter: the measure responds to blur, and it is taken on the
aligned crop so values are comparable between frames.
