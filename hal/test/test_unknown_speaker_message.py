"""An unknown speaker's turn must not carry an order to ask for their name.

The message HAL builds here is glued onto the transcript the model answers, so
anything imperative in it competes with the silence rules in the persona — and a
nearer, more specific instruction wins. That is how one word of somebody else's
conversation ("program.") produced a spoken "I don't think we've met, what's
your name?".
