# runtime-hermes-presync — run by switch-runtime right before hermes starts (and
# once at the end of install.sh). It OWNS the device-side Hermes model config in
# config.yaml, in two layers:
#
#   1. STRUCTURE (static) — the provider wiring that routes Hermes at the device's
#      campaign-api brain via anthropic_messages. `hermes claw migrate` does NOT
#      carry it across, and a factory reset (`hermes setup --reset`) WIPES it back
#      to defaults. We assert it idempotently here so it self-heals on the next
#      switch — without this, only the first install.sh run ever wrote it, and
#      switch-runtime skips install.sh once hermes is installed, so a reset left
#      hermes pointed at a broken/default provider with no path to recover. The
#      same layer also asserts two os-server-owned knobs: auxiliary.vision (the
#      image-understanding model) and agent.image_input_mode.
#
#   2. DYNAMIC (per-device) — the real llm_model / llm_base_url / llm_api_key and
#      channel tokens from /root/config/config.json, which override the defaults.
#
# This file is EMBEDDED IN os-server (runtimes/hermes/presync.sh) and materialized
# to /usr/local/bin/runtime-hermes-presync on every switch, so a plain os-server
# OTA refreshes it on disk — unlike a copy written by install.sh, which only re-runs
# on a first install / failed verify.

# `hermes claw migrate` imports the device's OpenClaw skills into
# ~/.hermes/skills/openclaw-imports. It runs from install.sh on first install, but
# a factory reset (wipeHermesState) wipes that dir while leaving the OpenClaw
# workspace intact — and install.sh does NOT re-run on a later switch (verify
# passes), so the skills would never come back. Restore them here when the dir is
# empty/absent. GUARDED so a normal switch is a no-op (re-running every switch with
# --skill-conflict rename would pile up renamed duplicates). claw migrate has no
# skills-only preset (it also touches SOUL/MEMORY), but that is harmless: the Go
# persona migration runs afterwards (os-server boot) and re-writes SOUL/MEMORY
# cleanly, so only the skills it imported actually persist.
