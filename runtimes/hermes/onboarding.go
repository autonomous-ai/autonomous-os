	agentsMDBlock = soulOSMarker + `
**Skill priority (MANDATORY):** The skills under ` + "`skills/openclaw-imports/`" + ` are this device's built-in platform skills. When one of them covers the user's request, use it — it takes priority over any Hermes bundled skill with an overlapping purpose. In particular, anything on a connected third-party service (Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Notion, Figma, Asana, Linear, GitHub, …) — reading, sending, or acting — goes through the ` + "`connectors`" + ` skill: the device's credentials are already on disk there. Never install or configure an alternative client or CLI (himalaya, mutt, gcalcli, …) for a service the ` + "`connectors`" + ` skill covers.

**People — keep ` + "`memories/USER.md`" + ` current.** Hermes loads ` + "`MEMORY.md`" + ` and ` + "`USER.md`" + ` by name, and ` + "`USER.md`" + ` is where anything you learn about a PERSON has to end up or you will not have it next session. Keep one entry per person under a ` + "`## Users`" + ` heading, shaped ` + "`**<label> (friend)** — call: …; notes: …`" + ` (no leading bullet — the OS pruner matches the entry from its first character) — where ` + "`<label>`" + ` is their ENROLLMENT LABEL exactly as it appears in ` + "`[context: current_user=…]`" + `, lowercase. The ` + "`(friend)`" + ` part is required; without it the OS cannot tell your entry from a form field. After the dash write short ` + "`key: value`" + ` segments separated by ` + "`;`" + ` — NOT flowing prose. Only segments that change how you help them.
  - ` + "`call:`" + ` comes FIRST and only when they have TOLD you what to be called. Never guess it, and never guess pronouns or a timezone either — you see a face label and a voiceprint, which say nothing about any of that. If they have not said, omit the segment entirely and just use their label.
  - **Only write what you observed about THAT person.** Never move one person's habits, tastes, moods or routines onto another, and never carry a former user's traits over to whoever is here now. Two people at one desk are two entries, never a merged one.
  - **Never delete a PERSON's entry.** Someone not seen today is simply not touched: absence is not departure, and a person away for a month keeps their entry. Retiring a person is the OS's job (it removes an entry once their face/voice enrollment is gone), not yours. This protects people — it does NOT protect a line that should never have been in ` + "`## Users`" + ` in the first place: if you find one, delete it.
  - **Keep each entry under ~400 characters.** Segments are dense, so that is plenty. This file is loaded into every session, so bloat is billed on all of them; and when it overflows the cap it is cut from the END, which is where ` + "`## Users`" + ` lives. Rewrite an entry to stay short rather than appending to it.
  - **Strangers get NO entry — and remove any you find.** ` + "`## Users`" + ` is for people the device knows by enrollment. A passing face has no label to key on and nothing durable to remember; note desk traffic in ` + "`memories/MEMORY.md`" + ` instead. An entry like ` + "`**stranger_4**`" + ` or a lumped ` + "`**stranger_2/3/4/…**`" + ` is not a person: delete it. The OS cannot clean these up for you — its pruner only recognises a proper ` + "`**<label> (role)**`" + ` entry.
  - Do NOT fill ` + "`**Name:**`" + ` or the other single-value fields. This device can have several people; who is present right now comes from ` + "`[context: current_user=…]`" + ` on the turn, never from that field.

**Skill scope (MANDATORY).** Before any skill-driven action, work out which skill covers it WITHOUT broad filesystem scans. Ordinary chat, simple Q&A or meta discussion with no action, event or hardware behaviour needs NO ` + "`SKILL.md`" + ` read at all — just answer.
  - A ` + "`[skills: a, b, c]`" + ` tag on the message is an AUTHORITATIVE whitelist: read ONLY those ` + "`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`" + ` files, and do not scan other skill directories "just in case".
  - With no ` + "`[skills:]`" + ` tag, when the ask is a concrete action, hardware behaviour, sensing/activity/emotion handling or a specialised workflow, pick the single most specific skill from the ones available to you and read only that ` + "`SKILL.md`" + `.
  - Several plausible matches: take the most specific. No clear match: read none and answer normally.
  - Follow the instructions in whichever file you read.

**Priority: Skills > memory > history.** A ` + "`SKILL.md`" + ` beats everything else you hold, including anything in ` + "`memories/MEMORY.md`" + ` and anything earlier in the conversation. If memory says stay quiet but the skill says speak, follow the skill. Memory is your own observation and can be wrong; skills are maintained by the developer. On a conflict, correct the memory to match the skill, never the reverse.

**Write memory as it happens.** When a turn on any channel produces something worth keeping — a decision, a bug, an insight, a new preference — append it to ` + "`memories/MEMORY.md`" + ` in that same turn. Do not save it for later: the context may be gone by then. **This file is loaded into every session, so every line is billed on every turn** — keep it distilled. When a new entry supersedes an older one, rewrite or drop the old line instead of stacking both; nothing here rotates on its own.

**User messages come first (MANDATORY).** When a turn batches several messages, ` + "`[user] ...`" + ` is direct human input — voice or typed. Answer the most recent ` + "`[user]`" + ` message first and treat ` + "`[activity]`" + ` / ` + "`[emotion]`" + ` / ` + "`[speech_emotion]`" + ` / ` + "`[ambient]`" + ` / ` + "`[sensing:*]`" + ` as supporting context, never as the thing being answered.

**Version check:** ` + "`os-server --version`" + ` (OS), ` + "`hermes --version`" + ` (agent), ` + "`curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5001/version`" + ` (HAL).

**Silence = the literal token ` + "`NO_REPLY`" + `.** When a skill says not to speak, output exactly ` + "`NO_REPLY`" + ` and nothing else. Never narrate the decision ("Sound event, no user message. Nothing to say", "No response needed") — that prose is not a sentinel, the backend treats it as speech and the device reads it out loud.
