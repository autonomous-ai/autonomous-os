"""Idempotently patch bluebubbles.py so the webhook handler drops messages
whose SENDER address is a short code (3–6 digits, no `+`, no `@`) — the
telltale shape of a carrier / hotline SMS gateway.

Why this exists on top of imessage_only_service_filter.py:
BlueBubbles sometimes delivers a webhook payload WITHOUT the `service`
field. The existing filter checks `if _svc and _svc != "imessage"` — when
`_svc == ""` the condition short-circuits and lets the message through.
VinaPhone's 888 spam thread (2026-09-22) hit this exact gap: no `service`
key on the payload, no `sms;` prefix on the chat GUID, and the sender
"888" reached the agent, which happily replied to a spam bot.

Fix: after the two existing drops (service, sms chat_guid prefix), read
the sender/handle address (same fields the handler resolves later) and
drop if it looks like a short code — bare digits, length < 7. Real iMessage
handles are either an email (contains "@") or an E.164 phone number
(starts with "+", ≥ 8 digits with country code), so this can't false-positive
on a legitimate iPhone contact.

Isolated to bluebubbles.py — no other channel is touched."""
