// Package agentfile owns the files that cross an agent turn's boundary in both
// directions: which device-local files a turn is allowed to hand OUT (and the
// scanner that finds the ones a turn named), and where a file attached IN by the
// user lands on disk.
//
// A turn can only NAME a file it produced — "take a photo" ends with an absolute
// path like /root/.openclaw/media/hal-snapshots/snap_*.jpg. Two very different
// consumers need to turn that into something a person can see:
//
//	GET /api/agent/file  (system/server/agent/delivery/http) — the web chat, on
//	                     the LAN, fetching the bytes directly
//	kind chat.file.get   (system/server/device/delivery/mqtt) — a phone, which
//	                     cannot reach the device at all, so it asks the backend
//	                     and the bytes come back over MQTT
//
// Both must agree on exactly what may leave the device. That is why the rules
// live here and not in either caller: a second copy is a second chance to widen
// one of them by accident.
