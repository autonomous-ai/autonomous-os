// Package versioncache caches an agent runtime CLI's version string and
// refreshes it when the binary on disk changes.
//
// Every runtime package (openclaw, hermes, picoclaw, codex, claudecode,
// opencode) used to keep its own atomic pointer filled once by a startup probe
// and never touched again, so a CLI updated under a running os-server — by the
// OTA worker running `software-update <runtime>`, or by a manual install over
// SSH — kept reporting the old version on the Status endpoint and the MQTT
// `info` message until os-server itself was restarted. The updater is a separate
// process, so there is nothing to notify os-server in-band; the binary's own
// size+mtime is the signal that survives every update path.
//
// Get() therefore stats the binary (cheap, no shell-out) and kicks an
// asynchronous re-probe when the stamp moved. The refreshed value lands within
// one poll interval instead of one restart.
