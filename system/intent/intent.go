// Package intent provides local intent matching for common voice commands.
// Matched commands execute directly against HAL APIs, bypassing OpenClaw
// for instant response (~50ms vs ~3-5s through the agent pipeline).
//
// Layout (one file per function group, all one package):
//   - intent.go         — engine: Result, Match, capability gate, shared helpers
//   - chitchat.go       — exact-match greetings/farewells/thanks (vi/en/zh)
//   - rules_led.go      — LED color / on / off / dim
//   - rules_scene.go    — scene activation + scene off
//   - rules_audio.go    — volume, mute, music stop, TTS stop
//   - rules_misc.go     — what-time and other hardware-free rules
//   - rules_tracking.go — servo vision tracking
