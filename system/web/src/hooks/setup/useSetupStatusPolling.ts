// Why this exists: the backend's own verdict is unreachable in the common

// error, but the AP tears down ~2s after submit — so from t=2s the phase poll
// can no longer reach 192.168.100.1, and the operator's machine has usually
// auto-rejoined its home Wi-Fi by then. The backend flips to phase="failed" at
// t≈62s with nobody listening, leaving the UI spinning on "joining Wi-Fi…"
// forever. This timeout is what turns that hang into a visible error.
//
// 80s sits deliberately past the backend's 60s network timeout plus the ~5-8s
// device-ap-mode needs to bring hostapd back up, so a device that IS about to
// come back has already done so — we never call failure on a join that was
// merely slow. Only applies when the AP has been unreachable (apLost) and no
// lan_ip was ever captured; a join with a known IP is handled by the LAN-IP
// probe, which succeeds the moment the operator rejoins their network.

// Pollers driving the post-submit "Setting up…" UI. Redirect is IP-FIRST —
// the raw LAN IP resolves on every network, so it's the primary target:
//   (1) phase poll — runs while setupWorking, hits the AP IP for phase/lan_ip
//       (the backend captures the STA IP early so the FE can read it during the
//       brief window the AP is still alive — see system/device/service.go).
//   (2) LAN-IP probe — once lan_ip is known, probe http://<lan_ip>/api/health;
//       when it succeeds (operator rejoined home Wi-Fi, device is up) redirect
//       to http://<lan_ip>/setup. Also runs as the pre-submit canonical-URL
//       upgrade so the URL bar moves off the soon-to-die AP IP onto the IP that
//       survives the AP→STA switch. Requires the device CSP to allow plain
//       `http:` in connect-src (the IP is cross-origin from the AP page).
//   (3) mDNS `.local` fallback — DISCOVERY ONLY, fires only when the IP
//       channel is dead: on a first-time setup the AP often tears down before
//       wlan0 even has a DHCP lease, so the phase poll never reads lan_ip and
//       (2) has no target. Once the poll has been silent >5s (AP gone) we
//       probe http://<mdnsHost>.local/api/health and redirect there. `.local`
//       is NOT the durable home — many routers block mDNS multicast (and
//       Android Chrome has no native mDNS) — it's a best-effort bootstrap;
//       (4) immediately moves the page back onto the raw IP.
//   (4) `.local` landing seed — when the page is served from a `.local` host,
//       fetch lan_ip once from the open setup-status endpoint so probe (2)
//       canonical-upgrades the URL to the raw IP.
