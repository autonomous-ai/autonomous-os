# Autonomous Intern

The deliberate inverse of Lamp: an always-on desk agent with voice, ambient (sound)
sensing, and an LED ring, but **no camera, no actuation, no display**. Intern proves the
platform is real — it is not a fork of Lamp. It is the same OS image declaring fewer
capabilities.

## What makes Intern "not Lamp"

Intern declares `audio`, `sensing`, `companion` (it pairs the Buddy app to drive a
computer), `light` (the LED ring), and `system` — Lamp's `vision`, `motion`, `display`,
`presence`, `media`, and `connectivity` are simply absent. The OS
boots the same runtime, mounts only the audio/sensing/light/system routes Intern declares,
and never brings up the camera, servo, or display drivers. Ambient sensing is sound-only
(the mic) — presence and motion perceptions need a camera Intern does not have. There
is no `if device == intern` anywhere in the OS.

Intern v2 adds mic + speaker — capabilities Lamp already has — so the two devices share
their entire audio/voice stack verbatim. That overlap is the whole argument for one OS.

## What the agent should assume

- No camera, no body to move, and no screen to draw on — it expresses through voice and the LED ring; vision (camera) is unavailable.
- The job is agentic work (mail, calendar, tasks, research), not expressive companionship.
- Same privacy posture as Lamp: local-first, ask before sensitive sensing.
