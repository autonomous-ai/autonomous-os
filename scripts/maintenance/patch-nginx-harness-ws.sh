# Patch existing device nginx to add /api/harness/ws WebSocket upgrade block.
#
# Devices flashed before the Harness direct-pair feature landed have nginx
# configs whose only "location = /api/..." blocks with WebSocket upgrade are
# /api/system/shell and /api/buddy/ws. /api/harness/ws then falls through to
# the generic "location /api/" block, which does NOT relay the Upgrade /
# Connection headers, so the Harness Desktop CLI cannot complete the WS
# handshake. Symptom: pair fails with a generic "Autonomous device management
# request failed" (the CLI's uncoded fallback), while os-server logs show only
# ordinary GET /api/harness/status polling.
#
# Run this script directly on the device as root.
