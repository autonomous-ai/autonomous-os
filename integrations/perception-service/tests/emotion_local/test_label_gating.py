"""Per-label gating: what a label must score before it is allowed to stand.

The gate is the only thing between a noisy FER read and a sensing event, and it
had no coverage. Anger is the label that matters. At 0.6 it was the argmax on
38% of triggers across a 500-trigger device session and never once correct — a
face turned toward a monitor reads as Anger to an AffectNet-trained model. The
observed maximum on that session was 0.91, so 0.8 removes the noise floor while
leaving the label reachable for a genuinely intense expression.

The second rule here is the one callers get wrong: a failed gate does not drop
the reading, it returns **Neutral carrying Neutral's own probability**, which is
typically low. So `confidence` on a returned Neutral is not a quality score, and
an empty HTTP response means "nothing cleared its bar", not "no face was found".
