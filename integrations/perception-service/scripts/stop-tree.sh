#
# The old `make stop-runpod-*` bodies sent one SIGTERM to two PIDs read from
# /tmp, slept 2 seconds, and printed "stopped" unconditionally. Three problems,
# all of which cost real outage time:
#
#   1. SIGTERM cannot stop a hung server. uvicorn's handler only sets
#      should_exit, and the only thing that can act on it is the event loop --
#      the thing that is stuck. Escalation to -9 is required.
#   2. The pid files are least trustworthy exactly when stop matters most: a
#      failed start overwrites them with its own dead PIDs (2026-08-10).
#      The listening socket is authoritative, so ask the kernel instead.
#   3. Reporting success without checking meant the next `start` died on
#      EADDRINUSE with no clue why. This exits non-zero instead.

# an older build shares the group of whatever launched it -- make, or the

# mid-stop, which looks exactly like a successful stop while leaving the server
# running. Such PIDs are still killed individually below.
