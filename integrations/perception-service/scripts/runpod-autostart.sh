# Bring the perception-service master stack up after a RunPod container start.

# RunPod rents pods on shared hosts and recreates the container without notice
# (host maintenance, migration). The stock runpod/pytorch template only starts
# nginx, SSH and Jupyter, so dlserver and lbserver stay down until someone runs
# make by hand — the pod reports RUNNING and keeps billing while serving 502s.
#
# Invoked from /post_start.sh, which /start.sh runs on every container start.
# Safe to run repeatedly: it exits early if dlserver is already up.
