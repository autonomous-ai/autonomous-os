"""Per-label confidence gating for emotion recognition.

Instead of trusting the raw argmax label unconditionally, each label can
require a minimum confidence. If the winning label does not clear its own
bar, the result falls back to ``Neutral`` (never dropped). Labels absent
from the threshold map pass through as plain argmax.

This keeps the three call sites (HTTP single-face, HTTP frame, WS stream)
consistent and is model-agnostic: thresholds are keyed by lowercased label
name, so the same map applies to PosterV2, EmoNet, and Emo-AffectNet alike.
