//! Bounded Gemini Live transport for a separately supervised provider process.

//! This crate does not admit speech, mint actuator permits, or decide addressees.
//! The caller maps each immutable [`Lineage`] to the original interaction owner.
//! Input transcription and provider VAD are session-scoped observations, never
