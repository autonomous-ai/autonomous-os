//! Automated voice acceptance runner and evaluator for lampOS.
//!
//! Scenarios are pre-registered, triggered from runtime/playback events with
//! bounded deadlines, and every attempt (including failures, withheld attempts
//! and expected silence) is retained in an append-only ledger.
//!
//! Evidence strata are never pooled. Fake-runtime results describe the turn
//! policy against declared or digital stimuli; they are not acoustic results.
//! Software timestamps stay separate from room-audio measurements, and a
//! missing acoustic annotation is unscored, never a pass. One loudspeaker
//! playing several synthetic voices cannot establish spatial speaker
//! discrimination.
