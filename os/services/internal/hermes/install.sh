# runtimes/hermes/install.sh — installer for the Hermes agentic backend.
#
# Published to the CDN at ${RUNTIMES_BASE_URL}/hermes/install.sh and fetched by
# /usr/local/bin/switch-runtime the first time a device switches to hermes. It
# is self-contained: nothing in the imager or os-server knows about hermes.
#
# This installer is self-sufficient: a direct `bash install.sh` fully configures
# AND starts Hermes — it no longer relies on switch-runtime to run the presync
# hook or to enable the unit afterwards. It still also drops the presync hook so
# later runtime switches re-sync the latest llm_* from config.json.
#
# What it does:
#   1. install the Hermes CLI, stop openclaw, then migrate skills from OpenClaw;
#   2. seed .env, then patch ONLY .model + .custom_providers in config.yaml
#      (yq, not a full-file overwrite), then run the presync hook once to pull
#      the device's real llm_model / llm_base_url / llm_api_key from config.json;
#   3. drop /usr/local/bin/runtime-hermes-presync for per-switch config sync
#      (since `hermes claw migrate` does NOT carry model config across);
#   4. install + start the gateway as a system service via
#      `hermes gateway install/start --system` (unit: hermes-gateway.service).
#
# Reference: hermes_setup.sh (~/Downloads) for the yq config patch + .env seeding.
#
# UNIT NAME: the gateway runs as hermes-gateway.service; we declare it in
#    /usr/local/lib/os-runtimes/hermes/service so switch_runtime.sh enables the
#    right unit.
#
# ⚠️ VERIFY ON DEVICE: `hermes gateway` must listen on 127.0.0.1:8642 to match
#    internal/hermes/constants.go BaseURL.
