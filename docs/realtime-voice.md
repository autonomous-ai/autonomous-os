# Realtime Voice Agent

Low-latency, speech-to-speech voice layer that runs **in parallel** with the
normal STT → agent pipeline. The realtime model handles casual conversation
directly (sub-second audio replies) and **delegates** anything that needs the
main agent (device control, skills, memory, real-time facts) back to the
OS-server flow.

Code lives in `os/hal/drivers/realtime/`; it is driven by
`os/hal/drivers/voice/voice_service.py`.

> **Source of truth:** this doc reflects the code. If they disagree, the code wins.

## Concept: handle vs. delegate

Every spoken turn is streamed to the realtime model *at the same time* as the
STT pipeline. At end-of-turn the model either:

- **Handles** the turn itself — chit-chat / quick answers — speaking back
  through TTS with no round-trip to the main agent, or
- **Delegates** by calling the `delegate_to_main` tool, which stops realtime
  output and forwards a one-line summary of the request to the OS server (→
  OpenClaw / Hermes) for the heavyweight work.

The `delegate_to_main` tool is registered automatically by the orchestrator
(`orchestrator.py`, `DELEGATE_TOOL`).

## Emotion expression (fire-and-forget)

If the device declares the `expression` capability
(`DEVICE.md` → `expression: { routes: [emotion] }`), the orchestrator also
registers an `express_emotion` tool (`orchestrator.py`, `EMOTION_TOOL`).
Devices with no face (e.g. mic + speaker only) never get the tool, so the
realtime model can't set an emotion — the registration is gated end-to-end:
`server.py` (`"expression" in _profile.capabilities`) →
`VoiceService(enable_expression=…)` →
`RealtimeOrchestrator(enable_expression=…)`.

Unlike `delegate_to_main`, `express_emotion` is **fire-and-forget** and is the
one exception to the model's binary "tool OR speech" rule — the model calls it
*in parallel* with speaking. When `stream_output()` sees the call
(`_handle_emotion_call`), it:

1. calls the HAL emotion handler **in-process** (`_fire_emotion` →
   `routes/emotion.py` `express_emotion`) on a daemon thread — the realtime agent
   runs inside the HAL process, so there is no HTTP loopback / serialization. It
   runs parallel to the audio already streaming, so the face changes without
   blocking speech;
2. acknowledges the call with `FunctionCallResultInput(trigger_response=False)`,
   which records the result in history **without** spawning a second model
   response. For OpenAI this skips `response.create` (`openai_realtime.py`); for
   Gemini the tool response simply lets the turn continue. Net added latency to
   speech ≈ 0.

The model is told (`resources/system_prompt*.md`, "Expression Exception") to
never wait for, announce, or speak the emotion aloud. Note this is distinct from
the non-realtime path, where the agent emits a `[HW:/emotion:…]` text marker that
the Go layer parses and strips — the realtime path never uses text markers.

## Providers

Two interchangeable backends, selected by `HAL_REALTIME_PROVIDER`
(`none` | `gemini` | `openai`):

| Provider | Class | Threading model | Default model | Sample rate |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Gemini Live | `voice_agent/gemini_live.py` `GeminiLiveAgent` | private asyncio loop on a `gemini-io` thread; send/recv threads submit coroutines via `run_coroutine_threadsafe` | `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` | 16000 Hz |
| OpenAI Realtime | `voice_agent/openai_realtime.py` `OpenAIRealtimeAgent` | fully synchronous; one `RealtimeConnection` shared by send/recv threads, serialized by a reentrant lock | `gpt-realtime-2` | 24000 Hz |

Both subclass `voice_agent/base.py` `VoiceAgentBase`, which defines the
queue-based contract:

- **Two threads per agent**: `_send_loop` drains `_send_queue` → API;
  `_recv_loop` reads API → `_recv_queue`. Both reconnect on error.
- **Non-blocking**: `append_audio()`, `commit_audio()`, `send()` (queue puts,
  gated on `available`).
- **Blocking**: `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `receive()` (a generator yielding
  `OutputBase` until a `TurnDoneEvent`, or until no event arrives within
  `HAL_REALTIME_RECV_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_S` — default 8 s — which ends the turn quietly
  so a silent/no-response turn falls back to the main agent without long dead-air).
- `available` ⇔ the websocket/session is connected (`_connected`).

### OpenAI connection safety

The OpenAI agent shares a single `RealtimeConnection` between its send and recv
threads. All connection writes, the connection swap during reconnect, and
teardown run under a reentrant lock (`_conn_lock`); the long blocking recv
iteration runs **outside** the lock on a connection snapshot so audio sends are
never starved mid-turn. Reconnect is idempotent (re-checks `_connected` under the
lock) and `_drop_connection()` only nulls a connection that is still current, so
the two threads can't tear down or rebuild each other's connection.

## Orchestrator

`orchestrator.py` `RealtimeOrchestrator` wraps a single agent session and is the
only surface `voice_service` talks to:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `start()` / `stop()` | Build the agent from config, connect, summarize memory on shutdown |
| `append_audio(frame)` | Queue one mic frame (non-blocking) |
| `commit_audio()` | Signal end-of-utterance (non-blocking) |
| `stream_output()` | Yield `AudioOutput` / `TextOutput` / `FunctionCallOutput`, or a `DelegateSignal` (then stop) |
| `send_text(text)` | Inject context (turn context, TTS history) as a non-response user message |
| `send_function_result(call_id, output)` | Return a tool result to the model |
| `save_turn(user, agent)` | Persist a turn to realtime memory |
| `available` / `sample_rate` | Readiness + provider audio rate |

## Context managers

The system prompt, device identity, device memory, and skills catalog are
assembled per agent gateway (`HAL_AGENT_GATEWAY`):

| Gateway | Class | Workspace |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| `openclaw` | `context_manager/openclaw.py` `OpenClawContextManager` | `HAL_OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR` (`/root/.openclaw/workspace`) |
| `hermes` | `context_manager/hermes.py` `HermesContextManager` | `HAL_HERMES_WORKSPACE_DIR` (`/root/.hermes`) |

`ContextManagerBase` (`context_manager/base.py`) handles prompt assembly
(`build_instructions`), turn persistence (`add_turn`), memory loading/trimming,
and summarization; subclasses implement `load_device_context`,
`load_device_memory`, `load_skills_catalog`, and `summarize_device_memory`.
Base prompts live in `resources/` (`system_prompt.md` plus per-provider
`system_prompt_openai.md` / `system_prompt_gemini.md`).

### Memory & summarization

Realtime turns are appended to a JSONL log (`HAL_REALTIME_MEMORY_PATH`, default
`<workspace>/realtime/memory.jsonl`), trimmed to `HAL_REALTIME_MAX_MEMORY_ENTRIES`
(keeping `HAL_REALTIME_MEMORY_TRIM_KEEP`). `RealtimeSummarizer` (`summarizer.py`)
condenses device + realtime memory via the **Anthropic Messages API**
(`HAL_REALTIME_SUMMARIZER_MODEL`, default `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`).
Summarization runs at `start()` (catch-up) and `stop()` (flush). The `start()`
catch-up runs in a **background thread** (after `connect()`), so the Anthropic
call never blocks the session from becoming `available` — otherwise an early
turn ("hello") right after a restart would leak to the main agent.

## Turn flow (in `voice_service.py`)

1. **Construct + start.** `RealtimeOrchestrator(gateway=AGENT_GATEWAY)` is built;
   `start()` runs in a daemon thread (`realtime-start`) when `HAL_REALTIME_ENABLED`.
   TTS `on_speak_end` is hooked to feed spoken text back as `[TTS HISTORY]`.
2. **Stream.** While the STT session is open, each mic frame is also resampled to
   the provider rate and sent via `append_audio()` (parallel, non-blocking), and
   buffered in `rt_audio_buffer`.
3. **Commit.** At session end, if enabled + `available` + audio buffered, the
   per-turn `[TURN CONTEXT]` (time, current user) is injected and `commit_audio()`
   fires.
4. **Consume.** `for output in stream_output()`:
   - `TextOutput` → sentences are flushed to TTS (`speak` / `speak_queue`).
   - `DelegateSignal` → stop; forward `[voice-instruction] …` + transcript to the
     OS server with the original `event_type`.
   - Otherwise the turn was handled locally → the OS server is told
     `voice_agent_handled` (so OpenClaw replies `NO_REPLY` and skips dead-air
     filler), and the turn is saved to realtime memory.

## Configuration

The realtime agent is configured from the **`realtime` block in the device's
`config.json`** (operator-facing knobs), with HAL's `HAL_*` environment variables
as a dev override and built-in defaults as the floor. Precedence per knob:

```
HAL_* env var  >  config.json "realtime" block  >  built-in default
```

os-server **seeds** the block into `config.json` on first start — and on upgrade
when it's absent — so the file always carries an editable realtime config. HAL
reads it directly (same as `llm_api_key` / `stt_language`), no push down. Because
HAL reads `config.json` at import, a config change needs a **HAL restart** to take
effect.

### `config.json` `realtime` block

Modelled in Go at `os/services/server/config/realtime.go`; read in HAL at
`os/hal/config.py`. Shared fields sit at the top; per-provider knobs live in
`gemini` / `openai` sub-objects, with `provider` selecting the active one
(`none` or absent → realtime off). Empty `api_key` / `base_url` fall back to
`llm_api_key` / `llm_base_url`.

```json
"realtime": {
  "enabled": true,
  "provider": "gemini",
  "gemini": { "model": "gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview", "voice": "Kore", "thinking_level": "MINIMAL" },
  "openai": { "model": "gpt-realtime-2", "voice": "alloy", "reasoning_effort": "minimal" }
}
```

The reasoning knobs (`thinking_level` / `reasoning_effort`) default to the
**cheapest** tier (`MINIMAL` / `minimal`), not the providers' max — raise them
explicitly for deeper reasoning. Knobs NOT in the block (turn detection, session
resumption, memory, summarizer) stay env/default-only.

### Environment variables (`os/hal/config.py`)

Each knob's `HAL_*` env var overrides the block (and is the dev-box path):

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `HAL_REALTIME_ENABLED` | `true` | Master gate for the realtime pipeline |
| `HAL_REALTIME_PROVIDER` | `gemini` | `none` \| `gemini` \| `openai` |
| `HAL_REALTIME_TURN_DETECTION` | `off` | `server_vad` \| `semantic_vad` \| `off` (Gemini: off = manual activity detection) |
| `HAL_REALTIME_RECV_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_S` | `8.0` | Max seconds `receive()` waits for the next output event before ending a silent turn (fallback to main agent) |
| `HAL_REALTIME_MIN_COMMIT_DURATION_S` | `0.8` | Sessions shorter than this with no STT transcript are treated as VAD noise and not committed to the model |
| `HAL_GEMINI_SESSION_RESUMPTION` | `false` | Resume the same Gemini session across reconnects. OFF by default — the `campaign-api` proxy doesn't forward the resumption handshake, so resuming through it yields a zombie session (cold reconnects work). Enable only against an endpoint that supports it. |
| `HAL_AGENT_GATEWAY` | `openclaw` | Selects the context manager (also from `agent_runtime` in config.json) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | — | Gemini key; falls back to `llm_api_key` |
| `HAL_GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL` | `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` | |
| `HAL_GEMINI_LIVE_VOICE` | `Kore` | |
| `HAL_GEMINI_LIVE_BASE_URL` | `<llm_base_url>/ws/gemini` | |
| `HAL_GEMINI_THINKING_LEVEL` | `MINIMAL` | `MINIMAL` \| `LOW` \| `MEDIUM` \| `HIGH` — cost-lean default (was `HIGH`) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | OpenAI key; falls back to `llm_api_key` |
| `HAL_OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL` | `gpt-realtime-2` | |
| `HAL_OPENAI_REALTIME_VOICE` | `alloy` | |
| `HAL_OPENAI_REALTIME_BASE_URL` | `<llm_base_url>/ws/openai` | |
| `HAL_OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT` | `minimal` | `minimal` \| `low` \| `medium` \| `high` \| `xhigh` — cost-lean default (was `xhigh`) |
| `HAL_REALTIME_MEMORY_PATH` | `<workspace>/realtime/memory.jsonl` | |
| `HAL_REALTIME_MAX_MEMORY_ENTRIES` / `_TRIM_KEEP` | `1000` / `500` | |
| `HAL_REALTIME_SUMMARIZER_ENABLED` | `true` | |
| `HAL_REALTIME_SUMMARIZER_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Anthropic Messages API |
