# Realtime Voice Agent

Low-latency, speech-to-speech voice layer that runs **in parallel** with the
normal STT → agent pipeline. The realtime model handles casual conversation
directly (sub-second audio replies) and **delegates** anything that needs the
main agent (device control, skills, memory, real-time facts) back to the
OS-server flow.

Code lives in `os/hal/drivers/realtime/`; it is driven by
`os/hal/drivers/voice/voice_service.py`.

> **Source of truth:** this doc reflects the code. If they disagree, the code wins.

## Concept: handle vs. delegate

Every spoken turn is streamed to the realtime model *at the same time* as the
STT pipeline. At end-of-turn the model either:

- **Handles** the turn itself — chit-chat / quick answers — speaking back
  through TTS with no round-trip to the main agent, or
- **Delegates** by calling the `delegate_to_main` tool, which stops realtime
  output and forwards a one-line summary of the request to the OS server (→
  OpenClaw / Hermes) for the heavyweight work.

The `delegate_to_main` tool is registered automatically by the orchestrator
(`orchestrator.py`, `DELEGATE_TOOL`).

## Providers

Two interchangeable backends, selected by `HAL_REALTIME_PROVIDER`
(`none` | `gemini` | `openai`):

| Provider | Class | Threading model | Default model | Sample rate |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Gemini Live | `voice_agent/gemini_live.py` `GeminiLiveAgent` | private asyncio loop on a `gemini-io` thread; send/recv threads submit coroutines via `run_coroutine_threadsafe` | `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` | 16000 Hz |
| OpenAI Realtime | `voice_agent/openai_realtime.py` `OpenAIRealtimeAgent` | fully synchronous; one `RealtimeConnection` shared by send/recv threads, serialized by a reentrant lock | `gpt-realtime-2` | 24000 Hz |

Both subclass `voice_agent/base.py` `VoiceAgentBase`, which defines the
queue-based contract:

- **Two threads per agent**: `_send_loop` drains `_send_queue` → API;
  `_recv_loop` reads API → `_recv_queue`. Both reconnect on error.
- **Non-blocking**: `append_audio()`, `commit_audio()`, `send()` (queue puts,
  gated on `available`).
- **Blocking**: `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `receive()` (a generator yielding
  `OutputBase` until a `TurnDoneEvent`, or until no event arrives within
  `HAL_REALTIME_RECV_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_S` — default 8 s — which ends the turn quietly
  so a silent/no-response turn falls back to the main agent without long dead-air).
- `available` ⇔ the websocket/session is connected (`_connected`).

### OpenAI connection safety

The OpenAI agent shares a single `RealtimeConnection` between its send and recv
threads. All connection writes, the connection swap during reconnect, and
teardown run under a reentrant lock (`_conn_lock`); the long blocking recv
iteration runs **outside** the lock on a connection snapshot so audio sends are
never starved mid-turn. Reconnect is idempotent (re-checks `_connected` under the
lock) and `_drop_connection()` only nulls a connection that is still current, so
the two threads can't tear down or rebuild each other's connection.

## Orchestrator

`orchestrator.py` `RealtimeOrchestrator` wraps a single agent session and is the
only surface `voice_service` talks to:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `start()` / `stop()` | Build the agent from config, connect, summarize memory on shutdown |
| `append_audio(frame)` | Queue one mic frame (non-blocking) |
| `commit_audio()` | Signal end-of-utterance (non-blocking) |
| `stream_output()` | Yield `AudioOutput` / `TextOutput` / `FunctionCallOutput`, or a `DelegateSignal` (then stop) |
| `send_text(text)` | Inject context (turn context, TTS history) as a non-response user message |
| `send_function_result(call_id, output)` | Return a tool result to the model |
| `save_turn(user, agent)` | Persist a turn to realtime memory |
| `available` / `sample_rate` | Readiness + provider audio rate |

## Context managers

The system prompt, device identity, device memory, and skills catalog are
assembled per agent gateway (`HAL_AGENT_GATEWAY`):

| Gateway | Class | Workspace |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| `openclaw` | `context_manager/openclaw.py` `OpenClawContextManager` | `HAL_OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR` (`/root/.openclaw/workspace`) |
| `hermes` | `context_manager/hermes.py` `HermesContextManager` | `HAL_HERMES_WORKSPACE_DIR` (`/root/.hermes`) |

`ContextManagerBase` (`context_manager/base.py`) handles prompt assembly
(`build_instructions`), turn persistence (`add_turn`), memory loading/trimming,
and summarization; subclasses implement `load_device_context`,
`load_device_memory`, `load_skills_catalog`, and `summarize_device_memory`.
Base prompts live in `resources/` (`system_prompt.md` plus per-provider
`system_prompt_openai.md` / `system_prompt_gemini.md`).

### Memory & summarization

Realtime turns are appended to a JSONL log (`HAL_REALTIME_MEMORY_PATH`, default
`<workspace>/realtime/memory.jsonl`), trimmed to `HAL_REALTIME_MAX_MEMORY_ENTRIES`
(keeping `HAL_REALTIME_MEMORY_TRIM_KEEP`). `RealtimeSummarizer` (`summarizer.py`)
condenses device + realtime memory via the **Anthropic Messages API**
(`HAL_REALTIME_SUMMARIZER_MODEL`, default `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`).
Summarization runs at `start()` (catch-up) and `stop()` (flush).

## Turn flow (in `voice_service.py`)

1. **Construct + start.** `RealtimeOrchestrator(gateway=AGENT_GATEWAY)` is built;
   `start()` runs in a daemon thread (`realtime-start`) when `HAL_REALTIME_ENABLED`.
   TTS `on_speak_end` is hooked to feed spoken text back as `[TTS HISTORY]`.
2. **Stream.** While the STT session is open, each mic frame is also resampled to
   the provider rate and sent via `append_audio()` (parallel, non-blocking), and
   buffered in `rt_audio_buffer`.
3. **Commit.** At session end, if enabled + `available` + audio buffered, the
   per-turn `[TURN CONTEXT]` (time, current user) is injected and `commit_audio()`
   fires.
4. **Consume.** `for output in stream_output()`:
   - `TextOutput` → sentences are flushed to TTS (`speak` / `speak_queue`).
   - `DelegateSignal` → stop; forward `[voice-instruction] …` + transcript to the
     OS server with the original `event_type`.
   - Otherwise the turn was handled locally → the OS server is told
     `voice_agent_handled` (so OpenClaw replies `NO_REPLY` and skips dead-air
     filler), and the turn is saved to realtime memory.

## Configuration

All via environment variables (`os/hal/config.py`); most fall back to the
device's `config.json` (`llm_api_key`, `llm_base_url`, `agent_runtime`).

| `HAL_REALTIME_RECV_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_S` | `8.0` | Max seconds `receive()` waits for the next output event before ending a silent turn (fallback to main agent) |
| `HAL_AGENT_GATEWAY` | `openclaw` | Selects the context manager (also from `agent_runtime` in config.json) |
