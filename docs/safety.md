# Safety Engine

The safety engine enforces a device's `SAFETY.md` bounds **deterministically in the
runtime**, below the agent. It is the mechanism behind the first principle in
`robots/contract/SAFETY-SPEC.md`: *safety is below the brain.* The agent requests actions;
the engine decides — on every request, regardless of who issued it — whether the
hardware is allowed to honour them and within what limits.

> **Status:** Slice 1 (brightness ceiling) is **implemented and enforced** —
> `hal/safety/policy.py` + the LED gate in `rgb_service.py`, loaded from
> `robots/lamp/SAFETY.md`. Later slices reuse the same loader + gate. Each table
> row below is marked enforced / reserved. This document tracks the code, not the
> other way around.

## Why an engine, not prompting

Routing safety through the language model is unreliable — it can be argued out of a
refusal, it can hallucinate a limit, and it cannot guarantee an action *did not*
happen. Guard mode in this codebase was already rebuilt to deliver alerts
deterministically for exactly this reason. The safety engine generalises that: the
runtime, not the gateway, is the single point that clamps, blocks, or stops.

## Architecture

Three layers, mirroring the device layer (`ROBOT.md` → capability → route → driver):

```
SAFETY.md front matter        the declared bounds (machine contract; per capability group)
        │  resolved via ROBOT.md safety_ref (path or http), parsed at boot
        ▼
hal/safety/policy.py        pure SafetyPolicy + gate functions (no IO, unit-testable)
        │  clamp_brightness(requested) -> min(requested, ceiling)   [slice 1]
        ▼
HAL capability routes          call the gate BEFORE actuating (led, later servo/music)
        │  deterministic, in-process, cannot be bypassed by the agent
        ▼
hardware
```

- **`SAFETY.md` front matter** — the bounds, keyed by capability group. Schema and
  field table: `robots/contract/SAFETY-SPEC.md`.
- **`hal/safety/policy.py`** — a pure loader (regex front-matter parse,
  dependency-free, same discipline as `hal/board/device.py`) producing a typed
  `SafetyPolicy`, plus pure gate functions. No hardware, no clock side effects, fully
  unit-testable off-hardware.
- **The routes** — each capability route consults the gate at the point of actuation.
  The LED route clamps brightness; later the servo route clamps speed/accel and
  guarantees `stop`. Because the gate is a plain function call in the request path,
  there is no path around it.

The policy is loaded once at boot (alongside the `DeviceProfile`) and exposed via the
device endpoint so the declared bounds are observable: `GET /device` already returns
`safety_ref`; the resolved bounds surface there too.

## Fail-safe semantics

Per-capability criticality (full rule in `robots/contract/SAFETY-SPEC.md`):

| Capability | Bound absent / unloadable | Rationale |
|------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| light, audio, motion | pass-through (log only) | enforcement is presence-driven and uniform: a declared bound is enforced, an absent one is not — the engine never invents a limit nobody wrote |

`SAFETY.md` is optional. The schema tag is validated like `ROBOT.md`'s — a missing or
unknown-major `schema` aborts boot rather than enforce an ABI it cannot read.

There is no separate kill switch: because enforcement is presence-driven, removing a
section (or the whole front matter) turns that enforcement off. To run a device with
unrestricted motion during bring-up, ship no `motion:` bounds; that is the off state.
A *malformed* bound (present but out of range) still fails loud — only *absence* is
pass-through.

## Slice roadmap

| Slice | Scope | Gate | Enforced where | Status |
|-------|-------|------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | `light.max_brightness` ceiling | `clamp_brightness` / `clamp_color` | LED gate (`rgb_service` `_handle_solid`/`_handle_paint`) | **enforced (v1)** |
| 2 | `quiet_hours` (light + audio) | `active_max_brightness` (time-aware) + `audio_quiet_now` | LED gate + music route | **enforced (v1)** |
| 3 | `motion.max_speed` (presence-driven) | `min_move_duration` | servo route | **enforced (v1)** (`max_accel` reserved) |
| 3b | `motion.stop_always` | — | — | **declared / structurally guaranteed** — no route-level gate consumes this field (see below) |
| 4 | fail-safe states (network/gateway loss → stop tracking; board fault → 503 isolation; `thermal.max_temp_c` → SoC over-temp health event + stop tracking; setup + servo over-current reserved) | WS-disconnect hook + per-capability `503` + thermal monitor (`thermal_over`/`read_soc_temp_c`) | `services` on WS disconnect + HAL routes/`/health` + `server.py` `_thermal_monitor` | **partially enforced (v1)** (setup + over-current reserved) |
| 5 | `audio.max_volume` ceiling | `clamp_volume` | `/audio/volume` route, above the speaker/BT-sink split | **enforced (v1)** |
| 6 | `motion.max_cog_offset_mm` (presence-driven) | whole-body centre-of-gravity score per frame (`recording_stability.py`) | recording load (`resample_recording`), physical + mock drivers | **enforced (v1)** |

Each slice adds fields to the `SafetyPolicy` and gate functions and wires one or more
routes; the loader and the front-matter contract do not change shape between slices
(fields are only added — the `autonomous.safety.v1` ABI).

## Verifying enforcement

A safety bound is only real if you can *prove* it holds and that the agent cannot get
around it. Each slice is verified at three levels; a bound is not "done" until all
three pass. (This is distinct from `robots/lamp/docs/security-test.md`, which covers
network/access-control security — ports, RCE, CORS — not actuation bounds.)

1. **Unit (pure gate, off-hardware).** The gate function is pure, so its limit is a
   table test: a request above the ceiling clamps to it, a request below passes
   through unchanged, an absent bound behaves per the fail-safe rule. Runs in CI with
   no device.
2. **Runtime (on the device, through the real route).** Issue the actuation request
   over HTTP and observe the hardware-bound value, not the requested one. The declared
   bound is also observable at `GET /device`, so the test asserts *request vs. ceiling
   vs. observed output* line up.
3. **Bypass audit (the safety-critical check).** Confirm there is **no** path to the
   actuator that skips the gate — issue the same action through every route that can
   drive it (agent path, direct route, any raw/low-level endpoint) and confirm each is
   clamped. A bound enforced on one path but reachable on another is not enforced.

### Slice 1 — brightness ceiling (checklist)

- [x] **Unit:** `clamp_brightness(255)` with `max_brightness: 180` → `180`;
      `clamp_brightness(120)` → `120`; no `max_brightness` → unchanged (pass-through).
      `clamp_color` scales hue-preserving (white→180,180,180; red→180,0,0). Schema
      missing/malformed/unknown-major fail-loud. (`hal/test/test_safety.py`, 21 tests.)
- [x] **Runtime:** verified on a real Lamp — `GET /device` returns
      `"safety": {"light": {"max_brightness": 180}}`; `POST /led/solid` at full white
      (255) reads back `[180,180,180]`, `[100,50,0]` passes unchanged, `[255,0,0]` →
      `[180,0,0]`.
- [x] **Bypass audit:** the gate sits in `rgb_service` `_handle_solid` / `_handle_paint`
      — the single chokepoint every pixel write funnels through. All callers (LED
      routes, effects, app_state, scene, gpio_button, presence, smooth_animation, main)
      use `dispatch(RGB_CMD_*)` → those handlers; the only direct `_driver` writes are
      inside them (post-clamp) and `clear()` (black). Grep confirmed no path skips it.
- [x] **Determinism:** `clamp_color` is pure and never consults the caller, so the
      clamp is identical for the agent, the Web UI, or a raw `curl`.

### Slice 2 — quiet hours (checklist)

Quiet hours add a **time** dimension: the LED ceiling drops and music is
suppressed inside a daily window (device-local wall-clock; the device runs all
day, so this is real time-of-day, not "off at night"). The gate reads the clock
on every request, so it flips at the boundary with no restart.

The clock is read via `hal.clock.device_now()`, which resolves the device's
**current** timezone from `/etc/timezone` (zoneinfo) on every call — so if the
user changes the device timezone at runtime, quiet hours track the new zone
immediately, without restarting HAL. (A plain `datetime.now()` would keep the
timezone glibc cached at process start.) Falls back to naive system-local time
when `/etc/timezone` is absent (dev/macOS).

- [x] **Unit (injected clock):** `in_window` handles the midnight wrap
      (22:00→07:00 true at 23:00 and 06:00, false at 12:00, end-exclusive at 07:00);
      `active_max_brightness` returns the reduced ceiling (40) inside the window and
      the base (180) outside; `clamp_color((255,255,255), now=23:00)` → `(40,40,40)`,
      `now=12:00` → `(180,180,180)`; `audio_quiet_now` true in-window, false out /
      when no policy. (`hal/test/test_safety.py`.)
- [x] **Runtime:** `GET /device` reports `safety.light.quiet_hours` +
      `safety.audio.quiet_hours`. With the window set to the current time, the LED
      ring clamps to the reduced ceiling and `POST /audio/play` returns
      `{"status":"suppressed"}`; outside the window both behave normally.
- [x] **Bypass audit:** the LED quiet ceiling rides the same `rgb_service`
      `_handle_solid`/`_handle_paint` chokepoint as slice 1 (no new path). Music
      suppression sits in `/audio/play` — the only route that starts discretionary
      audio (TTS is intentionally exempt).
- [x] **Determinism:** the window check is pure given `now`; the only impurity is
      reading the system clock, isolated in `policy._now()` so tests inject time.

### Slice 3 — motion (checklist)

Motion is **presence-driven**, the same rule as light/audio: a declared bound is
enforced, an absent one is pass-through (a device that ships no `motion:` bounds
moves unrestricted — that is the off state, not a refusal). `max_speed` is enforced
by *stretching a move's duration* (the move still reaches its target; only speed is
capped) — never by truncating the destination. Recovery actions
(`release`/`zero`/`hold`/`stop`) are never gated so you can always safe the body.
`stop_always` is parsed and reported as part of the declared policy, but no HAL
route currently consumes that field: this recovery property is structural (the
routes are ungated), not an independently enforced policy gate. `POST
/servo/stop` is the route that property exists for — it aborts a move or a
recording in flight and *holds* (torque stays on), reads no bound, and takes no
arguments. It is not `/servo/release`, which travels to a rest pose before
cutting torque; a stop that moves first is wrong for anything with wheels or
legs (#201).

The vision-tracking loop is gated too, and needs its own mechanism:
`min_move_duration` cannot bound it because there is no destination to stretch a
move toward, only a per-frame speed profile. `cap_speed_dps` clamps the loop's
own pursuit/saccade ceilings (55 / 100 deg/s, `hal/drivers/tracking/constants.py`)
to the declared `motion.max_speed` at the single place the profile is chosen
(`tracker_service.set_profile`). Those constants are tuning, not permission — on
Lamp (`max_speed: 120`) nothing is clamped today; a body declaring a lower
ceiling is what the gate is for.

Recorded animations are gated at load time rather than per frame. A recording
is resampled onto the playback loop's own fps grid, and any segment demanding
more than the ceiling is *stretched in time* — the same degradation the route
gate uses, applied per segment so a recording slows down exactly where it was
impossible and nowhere else (`hal/drivers/motors/recording_timing.py`, shared by
the physical and mock drivers so the simulator plays what the body plays). The
ceiling is the lower of the servo's measured limit (`SERVO_MAX_DPS`, 250 deg/s)
and the declared `motion.max_speed`.

Recorded animations are gated for **stability** as well as speed, at the same
load-time chokepoint. Every joint can sit inside its own range while the
*combination* puts the centre of gravity outside the base, and no per-joint bound
expresses that, so `hal/drivers/motors/recording_stability.py` reconstructs the
whole-body centre of gravity for every frame and **refuses** a recording that
reaches further from the base axis than `motion.max_cog_offset_mm` allows. Unlike
speed, there is no degradation that makes a tipping pose safe — the recording is
skipped, so the failure mode is a missing animation, not a crash. The geometry
comes from the body's own URDF via the `ROBOT.md` `urdf_ref` key; the check is
presence-driven and inert without both declarations, and a body that declares a
ceiling but no usable `urdf_ref` logs that it cannot score a pose and passes
through rather than failing closed. Lamp declares 22 mm (measured: the
third-party clip that tipped lamp-0c89 peaked at 31.6 mm, the worst shipped
recording at 17.7 mm, the other 28 at or below 17.6 mm — see
`robots/lamp/docs/motion-playback.md`); no other body declares it, so nothing
else changes behaviour. Derive the number per body from its own animation
library — it is millimetres of that body's geometry and mass, never a constant to
copy.

Recorded moves on the Reachy SDK path are gated differently, because the driver
does not own the playback loop: `ReachyMotionService` hands a trajectory to
`mini.play_move()` and the Pollen daemon streams it. There is no frame to slow
down, so the move is **scanned before playback and refused** if its peak head
rotation exceeds the declared ceiling (`peak_head_dps`, `_move_refused`). Speed
is measured as the true angle between head orientations over a ≥20 ms window —
per-axis euler deltas spike at gimbal crossings, and raw frame pairs turn
timestamp jitter into speeds the head never reaches. Head *translation* is not
bounded: `max_speed` is deg/s and `head_x/y/z` are millimetres, and no body
declares a translation limit — not enforced, so not claimed.

Refusal applies to every source including Pollen's own library, deliberately: an
official move tripping the gate is evidence the declared number is wrong, and
excusing it by origin would hide that signal. `robots/reachy-mini/SAFETY.md`
records how its ceiling was derived and what still needs a real robot.

### Learned-policy interface (dry run)

`POST /policy/run` is an interface-only endpoint for a learned controller such
as ACT or SmolVLA. It validates and logs `policy` plus `task`, returns a
`dry_run` run record, and does **not** import an inference runtime, capture an
observation, or issue a motor target. This is deliberately not a safety bypass:
there are no targets to pass through it yet. When execution is added, every
target must traverse the motion gate and `POST /servo/stop` must first cancel
the policy worker, then hold the body. `POST /policy/stop` clears a dry-run
request without touching a motor; on a body that also mounts `/servo/stop`,
that existing hardware stop first makes the same cancellation call, then holds
the body.

- [x] **Unit:** `min_move_duration` stretches a too-fast move (120° at 120 deg/s →
      1.0s), passes a slow one, bounds an instant (duration 0) request, passes
      through with no `max_speed` and with no policy at all, ignores joints with no
      known start; commented `# stop_always` is not parsed as a bound; `max_speed:
      0` fails loud. (`hal/test/test_safety.py`.)
- [ ] **Runtime (NOT yet verified on device — user deploys):** `GET /device`
      reports `safety.motion`; `/servo/move` at a tiny duration returns a stretched
      `duration` and the ring/arm moves at the capped speed; a device with no
      `motion:` bounds moves unrestricted (no 403).
- [x] **Bypass audit (routes):** the speed cap is applied at `/servo/move` via
      `min_move_duration` (the one endpoint that takes a duration). NOTE: internal
      animation (idle/emotion poses driven by the runtime, not the agent) is not
      gated — that is device-controlled, not agent-requested; revisit if needed.
- [x] **Determinism:** `min_move_duration` is pure (no clock, no caller identity).

### Slice 4 — fail-safe states (checklist)

Fail-safe is **state-driven** rather than per-request clamping: when the device loses a
critical dependency it falls into a safe posture deterministically, below the agent.
Three conditions are enforced today; setup-incomplete and servo over-current are reserved.

- [x] **Network / gateway loss → stop agent-driven tracking.** On gateway WebSocket
      disconnect, `runtimes/openclaw/service_ws.go` calls
      `hal.StopServoTracking()` (`system/lib/hal`) → HAL `POST /servo/track/stop`,
      so the body stops chasing a target it has no fresh vision for. Best-effort and
      guarded by `SetUpCompleted`. Key nuance: the device does **not** freeze or "hold
      pose" — local idle animation continues (it is local and harmless) and recovery
      reflexes (`motion.stop`/release, mute, sleep, wake) stay available; only
      *agent-driven* tracking and new motion stop.
- [x] **Board / driver fault → 503 isolation.** Already met: a faulting capability
      returns `503` per-route while the rest keep serving, surfaced via `/health`. No
      new mechanism — the fail-safe contract reuses the existing isolation.
- [x] **Thermal (SoC over-temp) → health event + stop tracking.** Presence-driven on
      `thermal.max_temp_c`: a background monitor (`server.py` `_thermal_monitor`) reads
      the SoC temp from `/sys/class/thermal` every ~10s via `policy.read_soc_temp_c`; the
      pure `policy.thermal_over` hysteresis gate trips at `max_temp_c` and clears at
      `resume_temp_c` (default `max−10`). On trip it sets `state.thermal_over`, logs, and
      stops discretionary tracking; idle stays alive. Surfaced at `GET /health.thermal`.
      Threshold is SoC-specific — read the board's own critical trip, not a generic guess.
- [ ] **Setup incomplete → reserved.** Not gated in the runtime yet (setup/identity
      reflexes only is declared intent, not enforced).
- [ ] **Over-current (servo) → reserved.** No servo current sensor wired; reserved for
      hardware/telemetry that exposes it.
- [x] **Unit:** `thermal_over` trips at/above `max_temp_c`, holds through hysteresis
      above `resume_temp_c`, clears at/below it, and is False with no policy / no thermal
      section / unreadable temp; `read_soc_temp_c` parses millidegrees → °C and returns
      None on any read error; parse defaults `resume = max − 10` and fails loud on
      `max_temp_c ≤ 0` or `resume ≥ max`. (`hal/test/test_safety.py`.)
- [ ] **Runtime (NOT device-verified):** the WS-disconnect → `/servo/track/stop` path and
      the thermal monitor are repo-level only; not yet confirmed on a live device (pull the
      gateway link; heat the SoC past `max_temp_c`).

### Slice 5 — `audio.max_volume` (checklist)

An all-day speaker ceiling, independent of `audio.quiet_hours`: the window suppresses
*discretionary* output (music), while the ceiling bounds *how loud anything gets*,
including spoken replies.

- [x] **Gate:** `policy.clamp_volume` — pure, no clock, no caller identity. Absent bound
      = pass-through (only the 0–100 scale clamp), the same presence-driven rule as
      `clamp_brightness`.
- [x] **Enforced where:** `POST /audio/volume` (`hal/routes/audio.py`), clamped **above**
      the sink split so the ceiling holds on the built-in speaker (amixer/DAC dB) and on a
      Bluetooth headset sink alike. The persisted volume (`config/.volume`, restored by
      os-server at boot) stores the clamped value, so a pre-existing higher setting cannot
      survive a reboot as an unbounded one.
- [x] **Bypass audit (callers):** every path that sets volume goes through this one route
      — agent/skill, `system/intent` (`rules_audio.go` "volume up"/"quieter"), the Monitor
      web slider, and os-server's boot restore (`config_watch.go` → `hal.SetVolume`). The
      gate sits in the route rather than in the callers, so none of them can be the thing
      that decides.
- [x] **Reported:** both `GET` and `POST /audio/volume` return `max_volume` (null when
      undeclared); the `POST` reply also carries the volume actually applied, so a caller
      never has to assume its request landed verbatim and a UI can correct itself at once
      instead of drifting until the next poll.
      `system/lib/hal.MaxVolume()` and the Monitor slider read it — advisory only, so a
      client that skips it still cannot exceed the bound; it just loses the ability to
      scale its steps. The slider bounds its track to the ceiling instead of letting the
      handle snap back from a dead zone, and `rules_audio.go` expresses "louder"/"quieter"
      as fractions of the usable range (otherwise, on a device whose ceiling is 40, a
      fixed "quieter" of 30 stops being distinguishable from "louder").
- [x] **Unit:** clamp above/below ceiling, pass-through with no bound and no policy,
      0–100 scale clamp, a `max_volume` nested inside `quiet_hours` not read as the all-day
      bound, and fail-loud on out-of-range. (`hal/test/test_safety.py`.)
- [ ] **Runtime (NOT device-verified):** repo-level only — not yet confirmed against a
      live speaker (set 100 via API, read back the ceiling; check the amixer/BT sink value).

## Relationship to existing ad-hoc enforcement

Some safety behaviour already exists, hardcoded and scattered: `motion.stop()` in the
motors/animation services, lerobot's mechanical position clamp, the LED brightness
scaling config. That mechanical position clamp is still the only per-joint position
limit: the command path has **no** declared position bound (recordings are gated for
speed and, since slice 6, for whole-body stability — neither is a per-joint clamp).
The engine does not rip these out at once — it *centralises* them
into the declared policy one slice at a time, so the bounds become data a device
declares rather than constants buried in drivers. Slice 1 introduces the engine with
a bound that has **no** prior enforcement (an agent-independent brightness ceiling),
proving the path end to end before migrating the existing pieces.
