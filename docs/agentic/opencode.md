# OpenCode agent backend

OpenCode is one of the **swappable agentic backends** the os-server can run behind
its agent gateway. The brain is pluggable (CLAUDE.md): os-server talks to
whatever backend `config.agent_runtime` selects through the single
`domain.AgentGateway` interface, so the rest of the pipeline (HAL TTS, `[HW:/…]`
hardware markers, Flow Monitor SSE, sensing drain, Telegram fan-out) never knows
which brain is active.

- **`openclaw`** (default): persistent WebSocket to the OpenClaw daemon. See `docs/os-server.md` + `runtimes/openclaw`.
- **`hermes`**: HTTP + SSE client against a local Hermes API server. See `docs/agentic/hermes.md` + `runtimes/hermes`.
- **`picoclaw`**: persistent WebSocket client against a local PicoClaw runtime. See `docs/agentic/picoclaw.md` + `runtimes/picoclaw`.
- **`codex`**: the OpenAI Codex CLI behind a local WS bridge. See `docs/agentic/codex.md` + `runtimes/codex`.
- **`claudecode`**: the Claude Code CLI behind a local WS bridge. See `docs/agentic/claudecode.md` + `runtimes/claudecode`.
- **`opencode`**: the **[opencode](https://opencode.ai) CLI** (open-source AI coding agent) as the device brain, behind a local WS bridge. This doc. Code: `runtimes/opencode/`.

## 1. Overview & how it is selected

The opencode CLI is driven **per turn** (like codex), so the device runs a thin
local **WS bridge**: the `opencode.service` systemd unit runs **`os-server
opencode-gatewayd`** — the bridge is **compiled into the os-server binary**
(`runtimes/opencode/gatewayd`; no separate process to materialize, no Python).
The bridge exposes `ws://127.0.0.1:18793/opencode/ws/` (bearer token
`autonomous_opencode_token`) and spawns **one subprocess per turn**:

```
opencode run --format json --auto --dir /root/.opencode/workspace [--session <id>] [--file <img>…] <prompt>
```

resuming the session id persisted in `/root/.opencode/session.json` (`--session
<id>` — a plain flag, not a subcommand, so there is no codex-style flag-ordering
trap). Turns are strictly serialized (buffered queue + single worker). The
permissive flag is deliberate: an appliance running as root must never block on an
approval prompt — `--auto` auto-approves permissions not explicitly denied (the
shipped 1.18.4 flag; the dev-branch `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is not in
released builds). Model/provider come from `opencode.json` (presync-owned, §1.2)
— the bridge never passes `--model`.

`agent_runtime` in `config.json` picks the backend; resolution lives in
`system/agent/factory.go` `ProvideGateway()` — `"opencode"` →
`opencode.ProvideService`, anything unknown falls back to OpenClaw. On startup an
`AGENT BACKEND ACTIVE → OPENCODE` banner prints `ws_url` + `conversation`.

Wire constants (`runtimes/opencode/constants.go`, no per-unit config):

| Const | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `WSURL` | `ws://127.0.0.1:18793/opencode/ws/` | Local bridge WebSocket endpoint |
| `Token` | `autonomous_opencode_token` | Bearer token on connect; the bridge reads the same value from `/root/.opencode/.env` (`OPENCODE_WS_TOKEN`, presync-owned) |
| `Conversation` | `device-main` | Label only — opencode owns its session ids (§4) |

State layout: the bridge's device-local state lives under `/root/.opencode/`
(`.env`, `session.json`, `workspace/`, `attachments/`, `install.log`); the
opencode CLI's own config/data live under **XDG** — `~/.config/opencode/`
(`opencode.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `skills/`) and `~/.local/share/opencode/`
(`auth.json`, sessions), with `HOME=/root`.

## 1.1 Install (`install.sh`)

An `opencode.setup` switch runs the generic `system/device/switch_runtime.sh`,
which materializes OpenCode's embedded scripts. `install.sh` (one-time, self-
sufficient — a direct `bash install.sh` fully configures AND starts the backend):

1. prerequisites `jq` + `curl` + `tar`;
2. installs the opencode CLI via the **official pinned installer**
   (`curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin
   bash -s -- --version <OPENCODE_VERSION>`) — it handles arch detection (linux
   arm64/x64), the `.tar.gz` asset + extraction, and is idempotent. Two device-
   learned gotchas are handled: the env var **must prefix `bash`** (in `VAR=x curl
   | bash` it binds to curl, not the piped bash), and the installer **still** put
   the binary in its default `~/.opencode/bin` on the test device — so a
   belt-and-suspenders step copies whatever the installer produced into
   `/usr/local/bin/opencode` (the path the unit + `verify` hook use).
   `OPENCODE_VERSION` is pinned (currently `1.18.4`) — the baseline for a
   freshly flashed image only: devices in the field update via
   `make upload-opencode <bare-semver>` + `make promote-opencode`, which the
   bootstrap worker applies as `software-update opencode`
   (`docs/bootstrap-ota.md` §5);
3. runs the presync hook once (`/usr/local/bin/runtime-opencode-presync`,
   materialized by os-server BEFORE the installer — §1.2);
4. writes + enables **`opencode.service`** (`ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/os-server
   opencode-gatewayd`, `EnvironmentFile=/root/.opencode/.env`, `HOME=/root`,
   `Restart=always`) — nothing to materialize for the bridge, it ships inside
   os-server; then drops a cheap offline `verify` hook (`command -v opencode` +
   os-server binary present) for switch-runtime self-heal.

Unit name == runtime name (`opencode.service`), so no `os-runtimes/opencode/service`
declaration file is needed. Install logs go to `/root/.opencode/install.log`
(persistent rootfs — `/var/log` is volatile zram on these boards).

## 1.2 Presync (`presync.sh`) — embedded, runs on every switch + every boot

`presync.sh` is embedded in os-server and materialized to
`/usr/local/bin/runtime-opencode-presync`. It runs before every opencode start
(switch-runtime), once at the end of install, **and on every os-server boot /
config change via `EnsureOnboarding`** (hermes pattern): `EnsureOnboarding` hashes
the presync-owned files (`opencode.json` + `.env`) around the run and restarts the
gateway only on a real change. It owns everything stateful:

- **§1 MIGRATE** — one-time persona/memory/skills copy from the openclaw
  workspace, gated on the marker `/root/.opencode/.openclaw-migrated`. Stops
  openclaw first (3 retries, non-fatal), then copies `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`,
  `KNOWLEDGE.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md` **and `AGENTS.md`**
  verbatim (opencode reads `AGENTS.md` natively — zero-translation persona slot;
  the Go onboarding re-injects the OS block anyway), plus `memory/` into the
  workspace and `skills/` into **`~/.config/opencode/skills`** (opencode's global
  discovery root) only when absent. The marker is written only after a clean copy,
  so a failed migrate retries next run; a factory reset wiping `/root/.opencode`
  clears it so migrate re-runs on the next switch.
- **§2 CONFIG** — regenerates `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` from config.json
  via `jq`. It writes a top-level `model` = `campaign/<llm_model>` (fallback
  `Auto-AI`) and a **custom provider** `provider.campaign` using the
  **`@ai-sdk/openai`** npm adapter with `options.baseURL` from `llm_base_url`
  (fallback `https://campaign-api.autonomous.ai/api/v1/ai/v1`) and `options.apiKey`
  = the **reference** `"{env:LLM_API_KEY}"` (resolved from `.env` at launch — the
  real key never enters the JSON). **`@ai-sdk/openai` (not `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`)
  because campaign-api speaks the OpenAI Responses API, not chat completions** —
  device-verified: `{base}/chat/completions` 404s, `{base}/responses` works, and
  opencode routes to the Responses API via `@ai-sdk/openai` (per opencode's
  provider docs). The existing `"mcp"` object is **preserved verbatim** — os-server's
  `mcp.go` owns those entries (§7), so the two owners never collide.
- **§3 ENV** — writes `/root/.opencode/.env` (systemd EnvironmentFile, mode 0600):
  `OPENCODE_WS_TOKEN` (must equal `constants.go` `Token`), `OPENCODE_PORT=18793`,
  `OPENCODE_WORKSPACE=/root/.opencode/workspace`, and `LLM_API_KEY` from
  `llm_api_key`.

Presync also writes `/etc/profile.d/agent-cli-env.sh` (interactive login shells
source the active runtime's `.env`, so a bare `opencode` in an SSH/web-CLI shell
reuses the campaign key — resolved live from `config.json` so it stays correct
across switches).

On top of the presync run, `EnsureOnboarding` (`onboarding.go`) does the same
workspace reconcile the other backends get: seeds `KNOWLEDGE.md` from the embedded
template only if absent, injects the OS-managed `<!-- OS DO NOT REMOVE -->` blocks
into `SOUL.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `HEARTBEAT.md`, refreshes the **global** user
AGENTS.md block (`~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`), and capability-gates skills.
Markdown-only changes never restart the gateway — each `opencode run` re-reads the
workspace; only a presync config change or a unit self-heal restarts it.

**Persona inline block (AGENTS.md).** opencode auto-loads `AGENTS.md` into context
(project `AGENTS.md` in the `--dir` workspace + the global
`~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`). Like codex, the persona is inlined INTO the
workspace `AGENTS.md` via an idempotent OS block (generated from `SOUL.md` +
`IDENTITY.md`), rebuilt on every `EnsureOnboarding` and right after a rename
(`UpdateIdentityName`) so the very next turn sees the new name.

### Skills — global `~/.config/opencode/skills` discovery

Device skills live in **`~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`** —
opencode's global discovery root (it also honors `.opencode/skills/` in the
project dir and `~/.claude/skills/` for Claude compatibility). All producers
target that XDG path: `presync.sh` §1 (openclaw migration), `skill_watcher.go`
(CDN download + the skill-change notify), and `pruneUnsupportedSkills`
(capability gate). Factory reset wipes `~/.config/opencode`, so the set is
re-migrated from openclaw on the next `EnsureOnboarding`.
`EnsureOnboarding` also refreshes every supported skill from the CDN on boot or
config reconciliation, self-healing a local skill that was stale before the watcher
started. It sends the skill-change notification after a possible gateway restart.
The watcher logs each successful metadata poll as `skill watcher: checked`; a ZIP
download or extraction failure leaves that skill's version pending for retry on the
next poll.

## 2. Transport & sending a turn

`client.go` holds one persistent WebSocket to the bridge (picoclaw-shaped: bearer
token, no pairing handshake, 25s ping keepalive → `pong`, reconnect with backoff,
`StateAgentDown` LED on drop). `chat.go` `sendChat` writes one frame and returns;
the reply arrives on the read loop:

```json
{ "type": "message.send", "id": "<reqID>", "payload": { "content": "<text>",
  "attachments": [{ "type": "image", "url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,…" }] } }
```

The bridge saves attachments to `/root/.opencode/attachments` and passes them via
`opencode run --file <path>`. A `{"type":"session.new"}` frame makes the bridge
drop the persisted session id (§4). opencode processes one turn at a time, so turns
are correlated by a single in-flight `runID` (the pending run id is adopted by the
first inbound frame of the turn).

## 3. Event translation (`translator.go`)

The bridge forwards the `opencode run --format json` JSONL events **verbatim**
(plus its own `bridge.status` / `bridge.error` / `pong` frames); every opencode
line carries a `sessionID`. The Go translator maps them onto the same
`domain.WSEvent` shape the OpenClaw handler consumes:

| Inbound event | Emitted `domain.WSEvent` |
|---|---|
| first line carrying `sessionID` | capture session key |
| `step_start` | `agent` lifecycle `phase:start` (once per turn) |
| `text` | **buffered as the reply** (device shape: `part.text`; flat `text` accepted as fallback); no token delta stream. A newer part demotes the previous to `stream:thinking` (see *Preambles* below) |
| `reasoning` | *(ignored — thinking, not content)* |
| `tool_use` | `agent` tool `phase:start` + `phase:end` pair |
| `step_finish` / `message.updated` | capture per-turn token usage (`part.tokens` / `info.tokens`) |
| `session.idle` (synthesized by the gatewayd on clean exit) | `agent` `stream:assistant` (whole reply as **one** delta) **+** `chat` `state:final role:assistant` **+** lifecycle `phase:end` with usage — ends the turn |
| `session.error` / `error` / `bridge.error` | `agent` lifecycle `phase:error` — ends the turn |
| `bridge.status` / `pong` | *(logged / ignored)* |

**Terminal event (device-verified 1.18.4).** `opencode run --format json` does
**not** emit a `session.idle`/`turn.completed` — a turn ends with a `step_finish`
whose `part.reason == "stop"`, then the process exits. Since `opencode run` is a
per-turn subprocess, a **clean exit (rc=0) is the turn boundary**: the gatewayd
(`turn.go`) marks the turn ended and **synthesizes a `{"type":"session.idle"}`
frame** so the translator finalizes exactly once. The buffered `text` is
surfaced there as a single assistant delta **before** `chat.final` / `lifecycle.end`
— the N=1 case of the streaming contract, which lets the shared consumer flush TTS
+ `[HW:/…]` hardware markers at `lifecycle.end`.

**Preambles.** opencode narrates before it calls a tool, as its own `text` part
("Using the sensing skill for this presence event."). Joining every part would
speak that whole trail — the same leak fixed in codex (see
[codex.md](codex.md)). So only the **last** `text` part of a turn is the reply:
each earlier one is demoted to `stream:thinking` (Flow Monitor only, never TTS
or a channel reply) as soon as a newer part proves it was not the reply.
Exception: a non-final part carrying a `[HW:/…]` marker is a real hardware
action and stays in the reply. Prompt wording cannot suppress preambles
reliably — this is the enforcement point.

**Usage:** token counts ride `step_finish` under `part.tokens.{input,output,cache.read}`
(also read from `message.updated` `info.tokens` when present). The translator
stashes the latest (`captureUsage` → `lastUsage`) and reads it at the synthesized
`session.idle`, mapping `input + cache.read → InputTokens`, `output → OutputTokens`,
`TotalTokens = in + out`.

## 4. Session

opencode owns the session: the `sessionID` is present on every JSONL line,
captured by the bridge and persisted in `/root/.opencode/session.json`, then
replayed via `opencode run --session <id>` (history lives under
`~/.local/share/opencode/` — process exit ≠ session loss). A resumed run whose
session no longer exists is retried fresh (the bridge's `resumeErrHints` catch the
missing-session error). `NewSession` sends a `session.new` frame → the bridge
drops the session id → the next turn is fresh.

`ShouldRotateSession` is a 150k-token safety net for runaway sessions. Per
[`adding-agent-runtime.md`](adding-agent-runtime.md) §4 "No fake success",
`CompactSession`, `UpdatePrimaryModel`, and `RefreshModelsConfig` return
`domain.ErrNotSupportedByRuntime` — never `nil` (an llm change still applies live:
the caller falls back to `EnsureOnboarding`, whose presync re-reads `llm_*` and the
hash gate restarts the gateway). Unlike codex, **`GetConfigJSON` does real work**:
opencode's config IS JSON, so it returns `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
verbatim (safe — the provider apiKey is a `{env:LLM_API_KEY}` reference; the real
secret lives only in `.env`).

## 5. Channels

Telegram, Slack and Discord are **device-owned** under OpenCode — identical to
codex (`SupportedChannels()` → `["telegram", "slack", "discord"]`). os-server runs
the receive loops itself, driven by `config.json` tokens read fresh on each use, so
there is nothing runtime-side to write and no restart needed. The full behavior
(receive loop, sender-metadata prefix, silent-run tracking, `stripForChannel`
cleanup, typing keepers, reply fan-out at `session.idle`) mirrors
[`codex.md` §5](codex.md) 1:1 — see `runtimes/opencode/{telegram_poll,slack,discord}.go`.
`AddChannel` / `RefreshChannelConfig` are honest no-op successes for the supported
channels and return `domain.ErrChannelNotSupported` for anything else (whatsapp).

### Telegram remote coding-sessions (`telegram_coding.go`, `coding_sessions.go`)

A Telegram chat can start a folder-scoped `opencode` coding turn and continue it
from the phone, separate from the device-main persona turn. Each accepted turn
spawns a fresh `opencode run --format json --auto --dir
<folder> [--session <id>] <prompt>` in os-server directly (independent of the
persistent gatewayd child); the reply is parsed from the opencode JSONL
(`parseOpenCodeResult`: `sessionID` → id, `text` → reply, `session.idle` → done)
and DMed chunked at Telegram's 4000-char limit. The exec env asserts `HOME=/root`
+ the presync `.env` pairs (there is **no** `OPENCODE_HOME` — opencode uses XDG
under HOME), so the coding child resolves the same `opencode.json` + auth the
gatewayd uses. A per-folder mutex serializes turns.

> ⚠️ **Cross-folder session discovery is intentionally degraded** in this pass.
> codex enumerated resumable threads by parsing its on-disk "rollout" JSONL store;
> opencode stores sessions internally under `~/.local/share/opencode/` and
> `opencode session list` is not confirmed to expose the working directory needed
> to resume in-folder across all projects. So `allCodingSessions()` returns empty
> (a `TODO(opencode-coding-sessions)` in `coding_sessions.go`): `/new <folder>` and
> per-turn `--session` resume work, but the `/resume` / `/sessions` **list** shows
> nothing until this is wired to a verified `opencode session list --json` (or a
> direct read of the session store) on-device (§10). Only the allowlisted
> `telegram_user_id` reaches any of this; the run is unsandboxed, so the allowlist
> is the security boundary.

## 6. Hooks

opencode ships no hooks loader, so OpenClaw's `emotion-acknowledge` hook is
reproduced **natively in Go** (`runtimes/opencode/emotion_ack.go`, mirroring
codex/hermes): on each user-visible turn, `sendChat` fires `{emotion:"thinking"}`
to HAL — same skip prefixes, same intensity, same capability gate
(`skills.SupportedHooks`) as the TS handler. The companion `turn-gate` hook is
intentionally not mirrored (`sendChat` already marks the turn busy). ⚠️ Keep it in
lockstep with `runtimes/openclaw/hooks/emotion-acknowledge/handler.ts` and the
sibling `emotion_ack.go` in hermes/picoclaw/codex/claudecode.

## 7. MCP connectors (`mcp.go`)

`WriteMCPEntry` / `RemoveMCPEntry` (the `connector.set` MQTT flow) edit the
top-level `"mcp"` object of `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` via
`encoding/json`, atomically (temp + rename) under `mcpMu`, then restart the gateway
so the next `opencode run` picks the server up. Shape translation from the
canonical OpenClaw-shaped entry: an **http** entry → `{type:"remote", url,
headers, enabled:true}`; a **stdio** entry → `{type:"local", command:[cmd,
args…], environment:env, enabled:true}` (opencode wants a single merged `command`
array and names the env map `environment`). `RemoveMCPEntry` is idempotent
(`removed=false`, no restart, when absent). presync regenerates only the
provider/model head and preserves the `"mcp"` object (§1.2), so entries survive
every sync. A switch **into** opencode also clones the previous runtime's MCP
servers via `MCPReconcile` (the write path).

## 8. Factory reset (`reset.go`)

`ResetAgent` (called by `server/system/factoryreset.go` on the active gateway)
preserves nothing — opencode.json/.env are regenerated by presync on the next
switch: **stop** `opencode.service` (+ verify inactive, 5s poll), **disable** it
(reboot defaults to openclaw), **wipe** the bridge state dir `/root/.opencode`
**and** opencode's XDG dirs `~/.config/opencode` (opencode.json, AGENTS.md,
skills/) + `~/.local/share/opencode` (auth.json, sessions) and the
`.openclaw-migrated` marker (so presync §1 re-migrates on the next switch) — then
recreate the baseline `workspace/` + `attachments/` dirs (the CLI recreates its own
XDG state on first run). `/root/config/agent_state.json` is wiped in lockstep with
`config.json` by the platform reset (per `adding-agent-runtime.md` §7).

## 9. Migration & platform wiring

- **Persona/memory** (`system/agent/migrate_persona/runtime_opencode.go`): one
  read + one write adapter over the opencode workspace, layout-identical to
  OpenClaw's (presync seeds it as a verbatim copy). Registered in the `adapters`
  map, so opencode migrates both ways with every other runtime. SOUL → SOUL.md,
  identity → its own IDENTITY.md, MEMORY + daily + KNOWLEDGE + USER to their native
  slots; `Overwrite=true` for SOUL. `rebrandToOpenCode` maps other runtimes' brand
  names onto OpenCode, and `reOpenCode` is consumed by the openclaw/hermes/picoclaw
  rebrand functions for the reverse.
- **LLM config** (`system/agent/migrate_config/runtime_opencode.go`): reads/writes
  `provider.campaign.options.baseURL` in opencode.json + `LLM_API_KEY` in `.env`,
  mirroring the codex adapter.
- **Version uplink**: `opencode --version` is probed at startup
  (`runtime.go` → `GetOpenCodeVersion`) and reported as `opencode_version` on the
  MQTT `info` message (`domain.MQTTInfoResponse`). The cache is a
  `versioncache.Cache`: `GetOpenCodeVersion` re-probes whenever the binary's
  size/mtime changes, so an update applied under a running os-server shows up
  without restarting os-server.
- **Switch triggers**: MQTT `opencode.setup` (`KindOpenCodeSetup`), HTTP
  `POST /api/device/agent-runtime`, and the web Settings **Runtime** dropdown
  (`AgentRuntimeSection.tsx`). `domain.AgentRuntimes` includes `opencode`, so the
  generic switch/validate paths accept it with no per-runtime code.
- **Logs**: the Flow Monitor "openclaw"/"openclaw-service" log tabs resolve to
  `journal:opencode.service` while opencode is active (`server/logs.go`).

## 10. On-device shakeout (2026-07-23, `intern-v2`, opencode 1.18.4)

Verified working end-to-end; four fixes came out of it (all landed):

1. ✅ **Installer dir** — the official installer ignored `OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR`
   (dropped the binary in `~/.opencode/bin`); the env var must prefix `bash` and a
   fallback copies the binary into `/usr/local/bin/opencode` (§1.1).
2. ✅ **Permission flag** — the shipped `opencode run` flag is `--auto`, not the
   dev-branch `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
3. ✅ **Provider wire** — campaign-api serves the **Responses API** (`/responses`),
   not chat completions (`/chat/completions` 404s) → provider is `@ai-sdk/openai`
   (§1.2).
4. ✅ **Terminal event** — `opencode run` emits `text` (`part.text`) then
   `step_finish` (`part.reason:"stop"`, `part.tokens`) and exits; no `session.idle`
   from the CLI → the gatewayd synthesizes one on clean exit so the translator
   finalizes the reply (§3).

Still open:
- **`OPENCODE_VERSION`** is pinned to `1.18.4` — bump as `anomalyco/opencode`
  releases move.
- **Coding-session discovery** is degraded (§5) — wire it to a verified
  `opencode session list --json` (or a direct session-store read) that exposes the
  working directory, then drop the `TODO(opencode-coding-sessions)`.
- **Deploy note:** the gatewayd runs as a **separate** process
  (`os-server opencode-gatewayd` under `opencode.service`); a binary-only update
  needs `systemctl restart opencode.service` too — restarting `os-server.service`
  alone leaves the old gatewayd running (an OTA that also bumps presync config
  triggers the hash-gated gateway restart automatically).
