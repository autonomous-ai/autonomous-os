# PicoClaw agent backend

PicoClaw is one of the **swappable agentic backends** the os-server can run
behind its agent gateway. The brain is pluggable (CLAUDE.md): os-server talks to
whatever backend `config.agent_runtime` selects through the single
`domain.AgentGateway` interface, so the rest of the pipeline (HAL TTS, `[HW:/…]`
hardware markers, Flow Monitor SSE, sensing drain, Telegram fan-out) never knows
which brain is active.

- **`openclaw`** (default): persistent WebSocket to the OpenClaw daemon. See `docs/os-server.md` + `runtimes/openclaw`.
- **`hermes`**: HTTP + SSE client against a local Hermes API server. See `docs/agentic/hermes.md` + `runtimes/hermes`.
- **`picoclaw`**: persistent WebSocket client against a local PicoClaw runtime. This doc. Code: `runtimes/picoclaw/`.

## 1. When and how it is selected

`agent_runtime` in `config.json` picks the backend; resolution lives in
`system/agent/factory.go` `ProvideGateway()`:

| `agent_runtime` | Backend |
|---|---|
| `"openclaw"` / unset | OpenClaw (default; or `gateway.default` from `DEVICE.md`) |
| `"hermes"` | Hermes (`hermes.ProvideService`) |
| `"picoclaw"` | PicoClaw (`picoclaw.ProvideService`) |
| anything else | OpenClaw (logged as `FALLBACK — unknown runtime=…`) |

On startup `ProvideGateway` prints an `AGENT BACKEND ACTIVE → PICOCLAW` banner
with `ws_url`, `conversation`, and `source`.

## 1.1 Install + provisioning (`install.sh` + `presync.sh`)

A `picoclaw.setup` switch runs the generic `system/device/switch_runtime.sh`,
which materializes PicoClaw's embedded scripts and drives them. The two scripts
live next to the backend and are embedded + registered in `install.go`:

| Script | On-disk path | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| `install.sh` | `/usr/local/lib/os-runtimes/picoclaw/install.sh` | first switch / failed `verify` |
| `presync.sh` | `/usr/local/bin/runtime-picoclaw-presync` | **before every** picoclaw start (and once at end of install) |

**`install.sh`** (one-time):
1. installs `jq` + `yq` + the pinned `picoclaw` binary (GitHub release,
   `picoclaw-linux-arm64`) into `/usr/local/bin`;
2. `picoclaw onboard` (only when `config.json` is absent) creates `/root/.picoclaw`
   — workspace + a baseline `config.json` and `.security.yml`;
3. writes **`picoclaw.service`** (`ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/picoclaw gateway`,
   `HOME=/root`, `Restart=always`) — `picoclaw gateway` only runs in the foreground,
   so unlike hermes (which ships `gateway install --system`) we wrap it ourselves.
   The unit name equals the runtime name, so **no** `os-runtimes/picoclaw/service`
   declaration file is needed (switch-runtime defaults to it);
4. runs the presync hook once, then drops a `verify` hook (`command -v picoclaw`) so
   switch-runtime can detect + self-heal an orphaned unit.

**`presync.sh`** (every switch — single owner of model + channel config, so it
self-heals after a factory reset, mirroring hermes' presync):
- **§0 migrate** — gated on a sentinel marker `~/.picoclaw/.openclaw-migrated`
  (**not** on `workspace/skills` emptiness — PicoClaw ships built-in skills so that
  dir is always non-empty). When the marker is absent and `/root/.openclaw` exists,
  stop openclaw and run `picoclaw migrate --workspace-only --force` to carry
  persona/memory/skills over from OpenClaw. **`--workspace-only`** means migrate does
  NOT touch `config.json` — converting `openclaw.json` into a picoclaw config produces
  a broken config, so `config.json` stays the valid onboard baseline and §1/§2 assert
  model/channel/gateway on top. It then does the file fixups migrate doesn't: copy
  `HEARTBEAT.md` + `KNOWLEDGE.md` from the
  openclaw workspace (KNOWLEDGE.md is openclaw's living learnings doc, seeded from an
  embedded template then appended daily — migrate skips it), delete `AGENT.md` (so
  PicoClaw runs the legacy `AGENTS.md` path — the only mode that reads `IDENTITY.md`),
  and copy openclaw's `IDENTITY.md` over (migrate skips it too). Finally it writes the
  marker. A factory reset wiping `/root/.picoclaw` clears
  the marker so migrate re-runs; a failed migrate leaves the marker unwritten and
  retries next switch.
- **§0.5 onboarding (`onboarding.go`)** — `EnsureOnboarding`, called on
  boot/config-change like openclaw/hermes, mirrors openclaw's reconcile (trimmed):
  - seeds `KNOWLEDGE.md` from an embedded template (`resources/KNOWLEDGE.md`) **only
    if absent** — covers the fresh picoclaw-only device where presync §0 had no
    openclaw copy; never overwrites;
  - injects the OS-managed `<!-- OS DO NOT REMOVE -->` blocks into `SOUL.md`
    (`ensureSoulMDBlock`, per-device-type soul from DEVICE.md `soul_ref`; owner
    content below `---` preserved), `AGENTS.md` (`ensureAgentsMDBlock`,
    skills/connectors/memory/priority rules — the **Connectors (MANDATORY)** block
    routes any Gmail/Calendar/Drive/… request through the `connectors` skill
    (credentials on disk at `/root/.openclaw/workspace/configs/<code>_access_tokens.json`)
    so the agent never installs its own mail client), and `HEARTBEAT.md` (`ensureHeartbeatMDBlock`,
    daily knowledge-synthesis) — mirroring openclaw but stripped of OpenClaw-only
    content, so the blocks stay current on a plain os-server OTA;
  - **capability-gates skills** (`pruneUnsupportedSkills`): removes skill dirs the
    device can't use — a skill survives if it is supported by `skills.Supported(caps)`
    (the same gate openclaw uses) **or** is a picoclaw built-in
    (`picoclawBuiltinSkills`: `agent-browser`, `github`, `hardware`, `skill-creator`,
    `summarize`, `tmux`, `weather`); everything else under `workspace/skills` is
    deleted. Fail-open when DEVICE.md declares no caps. No reload (skills read per-turn);
  - when any block changed, **restarts the gateway** (`restartPicoclawGateway` →
    `systemctl restart picoclaw`) so it re-reads the workspace files (log+skip when
    systemctl is unavailable). Not the gateway `/reload` endpoint — it needs an admin
    auth we don't hold (the pico channel token is rejected) and isn't confirmed to
    re-read workspace markdown; a restart reliably does.
  - openclaw.json-specific steps (hooks/logging/controlUi registration) are N/A for
    picoclaw's `config.json`; queue/steer pinning is TODO.

A separate **skill watcher** (`skill_watcher.go`, started at boot like openclaw)
polls OTA metadata every 5 min and auto-updates `workspace/skills/<name>` from the
CDN when a supported skill's version bumps (capability-gated via
`skills.Supported`), then notifies the agent with `SendSystemChatMessage`.
- **§1 structure** (`jq` on `config.json`) — `agents.defaults` (provider
  `anthropic-messages`, `model_name "autonomous"`, `image_model "autonomous_vision"`,
  `restrict_to_workspace:false`, `allow_read_outside_workspace:true`), the `autonomous`
  and `autonomous_vision` (`qwen/qwen3.6-plus`, same campaign-api endpoint) `model_list`
  entries, and the `channel_list` skeleton. `channel_list.pico` is always enabled.
- **§2 dynamic** (secrets from the **project** `/root/config/config.json`, which
  wins) — `model_list[autonomous,autonomous_vision].api_base` from `llm_base_url`
  (PicoClaw needs a trailing `/v1`, unlike hermes), `.security.yml`
  `model_list."autonomous:0".api_keys` + `"autonomous_vision:0".api_keys` from
  `llm_api_key`, the `pico` bearer token (must equal `constants.go` `Token`),
  and each non-pico channel **enabled only when its credentials exist**: telegram
  (`telegram_bot_token` + `telegram_user_id`), discord (`discord_bot_token` +
  `discord_user_id`), slack (`slack_bot_token` + `slack_app_token` + `slack_user_id`),
  whatsapp native (`whatsapp_user_id` → `allow_from`, no token, QR pairing on first
  run). Secrets land in `.security.yml` under `channel_list.<ch>.settings`; structure
  stays in `config.json`.

The running gateway logs confirm the wiring on boot (`Gateway started on
127.0.0.1:18790`, health at `/health` `/ready` `/reload`, `Channels enabled:
[pico]`). A `SECURITY: Channel allows EVERYONE (allow_from is empty) channel=pico`
warning is expected: `pico` is the device-local native gateway and intentionally
has no `allow_from`.

## 2. Wire constants

There is **no per-unit config**; the endpoint is a compile-time constant in
`runtimes/picoclaw/constants.go`:

| Const | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `WSURL` | `ws://127.0.0.1:18790/pico/ws/` | Local PicoClaw WebSocket endpoint |
| `Token` | `darren_pico_token` | Bearer token sent in the `Authorization` header on connect |
| `Conversation` | `device-main` | Default session label until the server assigns a `session_id` |

## 3. Transport

`client.go` holds **one persistent WebSocket** (gorilla/websocket), mirroring the
openclaw reconnect loop but simplified — PicoClaw has **no challenge / pairing
handshake**, just a bearer token:

1. `StartWS` dials `WSURL` with `Authorization: Bearer <Token>`.
2. On connect, readiness flips true (`IsReady`/`ConnectedAt`), the `StateAgentDown`
   LED clears, and a reconnect (not first-connect) plays the i18n reconnect TTS.
3. A keepalive goroutine sends `{"type":"ping","id":…}` every 25s; PicoClaw replies
   `pong` (ignored) which refreshes the 90s read deadline.
4. The read loop translates each inbound frame and dispatches into the registered
   `domain.AgentEventHandler` (synchronously — safe because `FetchChatHistory` is a
   no-op here, so the handler never blocks on a WS RPC).
5. On drop: clear busy + in-flight turn ids, paint `StateAgentDown`, stop servo
   tracking (motion devices only), back off 5s, reconnect.

## 4. Sending a turn

`chat.go` `sendChat` writes one frame and returns immediately (the reply arrives
on the read loop):

```json
{ "type": "message.send", "id": "<reqID>", "payload": { "content": "<text>" }, "session_id": "<if known>" }
```

- Image turns add `payload.attachments: [{ "type": "image", "url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,…" }]` (best-effort; the text content is always sent so the turn proceeds even if the attachment shape is ignored).
- Before the write: mark busy, stash the `runID` as the **pending run id**, record a pending chat trace, and emit `chat_input` / `chat_send` flow events (parity with openclaw).

PicoClaw processes **one turn at a time** and does not stream tokens, so turns
are correlated by a single in-flight `runID` rather than a per-frame id: the
pending run id is adopted by the first inbound frame of the turn.

## 5. Inbound protocol → `domain.WSEvent` mapping

This is the critical part for correct Flow Monitor / web-chat rendering. The
frame `type` alone is **not** enough — `message.create` / `message.update` must
be classified by their payload (`placeholder` / `kind` / `tool_calls` / `content`),
in this priority order (`translator.go` `categorize`):

| Inbound frame | Classified as | Emitted `domain.WSEvent` |
|---|---|---|
| `typing.start` | turn start | `agent` lifecycle `phase:start` (once per turn) |
| `message.create/update`, `placeholder:true` | thinking | *(none — status, not content)* |
| `message.create/update`, `kind:"thought"` / `thought:true` | reasoning | *(none — rendered as status only)* |
| `message.create`, `kind:"tool_calls"` / has `tool_calls` | tool call | `agent` tool `phase:start` + `phase:end` per call |
| `message.create/update`, non-empty `content` (none of the above) | **final answer** | `agent` `stream:assistant` (whole reply as one delta) **+** `chat` `state:final role:assistant` **+** `agent` lifecycle `phase:end` (with usage) — **ends the turn** |
| `error` | error | `agent` lifecycle `phase:error` — ends the turn |
| `typing.stop` / `message.delete` / `pong` | — | *(ignored)* |

### Turn lifecycle gotchas

- **`typing.stop` is NOT the end of the turn.** It arrives early, right after the
  thinking phase. The turn ends only on the first **final** frame (or `error`).
- **No-tool turn:** `typing.start → placeholder → typing.stop → message.update (final)`.
  The final is a `message.update` that reuses the placeholder's `message_id`.
- **Tool turn:** `placeholder → typing.stop → message.delete (placeholder removed)
  → message.create kind:"tool_calls" (×N) → message.create (clean, final)`.
- PicoClaw does not emit a separate tool-result frame, so each tool call emits a
  `tool` `phase:start` immediately followed by a `phase:end` with an empty result,
  purely to close the trace.
- **Non-streaming → one assistant delta.** PicoClaw delivers the whole reply in a
  single final frame, but the shared consumer derives TTS + `[HW:/…]` hardware
  markers (and the Flow Monitor `tts_speak` / `hw_*` nodes) from the **assistant-delta
  stream**, flushed at `lifecycle.end`. So the final answer is surfaced as `agent`
  `stream:assistant` — the whole reply (markers intact) as **one** delta — **before**
  `chat.final` / `lifecycle.end`, the N=1 case of the openclaw/hermes streaming
  contract. Without it the reply renders in web chat but never reaches the speaker or
  hardware. `translator.go` `emitFinal`.
- `media.create` is defined in the protocol but the server never emits it — media
  rides inside `message.create` as `attachments`.

### Tool call shape

Each entry in `tool_calls` is OpenAI-style: name + params live in
`function.name` and `function.arguments` (a **JSON string**, not an object). The
agent's human-readable lead-in is in `extra_content.tool_feedback_explanation`
(may contain stray ANSI control chars from terminal input). The current
translator forwards `name` + `arguments`; the explanation is logged but not
surfaced (the device `AgentPayload` has no slot for it).

### Token usage

`context_usage` (only on the final frame) is cumulative context size, not
per-turn input/output. It maps to `TokenUsage{ InputTokens: history_tokens,
TotalTokens: used_tokens }`.

## 6. Session

PicoClaw owns the session: the server-assigned `session_id` is captured from any
inbound frame and stored (`SetSessionKey`) so the next `message.send` echoes it.
`NewSession` just clears the local id so the next turn starts a fresh server
session. There is no compact RPC, so `CompactSession` returns
`domain.ErrNotSupportedByRuntime` (the caller logs and rotates via `NewSession`
instead).

## 7. Channel capability

PicoClaw runs **telegram only**. The Telegram receive loop is **device-owned**
(driven by `config.TelegramBotToken`), and PicoClaw has no slack/discord delivery
of its own. The three channel methods in `runtimes/picoclaw/channels.go` encode
this honestly:

| Method | telegram | slack / discord / whatsapp |
|---|---|---|
| `SupportedChannels()` | returns `[telegram]` (the only entry) | — |
| `AddChannel(…)` | honest **no-op success** — telegram is device-owned, so there is nothing to write into the runtime | returns `domain.ErrChannelNotSupported` |
| `RefreshChannelConfig(…)` | `("", nil)` — success no-op (no runtime re-apply needed) | returns `domain.ErrChannelNotSupported` |

This is part of a **repo-wide generic capability model**: every runtime declares
`SupportedChannels()` and returns `domain.ErrChannelNotSupported` (the string
`"channel_not_supported"`) for channels it cannot run, instead of the old silent
no-op. The shared not-supported behavior and the post-switch `ChannelReconcile`
are documented in [`adding-agent-runtime.md`](adding-agent-runtime.md) — see there
rather than duplicating here.

**Switching FROM openclaw → picoclaw:** if openclaw had slack/discord configured,
those channels become unsupported under PicoClaw. After the switch
`ChannelReconcile` reports them in the MQTT info uplink's `unsupported_channels`
field (`domain.MQTTInfoResponse`), and their creds **stay in `config.json`** —
switching back to openclaw restores them.

## 7.1 Channel turns in Flow Monitor (observer hook)

A Telegram turn is handled entirely inside the PicoClaw gateway (it owns the
channel I/O) and never crosses the WebSocket, so — exactly like Hermes — os-server
would be blind to it. Parity is restored with an **observer hook**, the direct
analogue of the Hermes `os-server-observer` hook: os-server ships a small
subprocess that the gateway runs on its shared agent pipeline, and that subprocess
forwards each turn to the loopback `POST /api/agent/channel-turn` endpoint the
shared `ChannelTurn` handler already serves (`handler_channel_turn.go`). No
consumer/UI change — the inbound user text lights up the IN node, and any
`[HW:/…]` markers in the reply drive the local hardware, same as Hermes.

Two things differ from Hermes and are owned by `runtimes/picoclaw/hooks.go`:

1. **Transport.** PicoClaw process hooks are a **subprocess speaking NDJSON
   JSON-RPC over stdio** (`resources/hooks/os-server-observer/observer.py`), not an
   in-process Python `handle()` discovered by directory scan. PicoClaw sends the
   subprocess (verified on-device, picoclaw 0.2.9):
   - `hook.hello` — a REQUEST (has JSON-RPC `id`); the script replies
     `{"action":"continue"}`. Any request (has `id`) is answered immediately so the
     turn is never blocked.
   - `hook.runtime_event` — a NOTIFICATION whose `params` is the event envelope
     `{kind, scope{channel,chat_id,sender_id,session_key,turn_id}, payload}`. The
     script acts on two kinds and ignores the rest (`agent.tool.*`, `agent.llm.*`):
     - `agent.turn.start` → `agent:start`, message = **`payload.UserMessage`**.
     - `agent.turn.end`   → `agent:end`, response = **`payload.FinalContent`** (the
       reply, WITH any `[HW:/…]` markers — `agent.turn.end` carries both the user
       message and the final reply, so **observe alone suffices; no intercept**).
   - forwards **every** channel by default (channel-agnostic, like the Hermes hook —
     `OBSERVER_CHANNELS` is an optional allow-list, empty = all) and drops internal
     senders (`sender_id == heartbeat`). The device-local `pico` turns os-server
     already logs via `sendChat`/`session.message` are excluded downstream by
     `skipPlatform` (`channelHookSkipPlatforms` now includes `pico`, alongside
     `api_server`/`cli`) — so forwarding-all cannot double-count or double-fire the
     ack. This is the exact analogue of how Hermes excludes its own `api_server` turns.
   - maps `scope` → the `ChannelTurn` payload (`platform=channel`, `chat_id`,
     `sender_id`→`user_id`, `session_key`→`session_id`). PicoClaw pairs the two
     forwards into one Flow turn by `session_key`.
   - the POST fires on a daemon thread (audit log stays synchronous) so a slow
     os-server never stalls the next event (`observer_timeout_ms` is 500ms).
   - `OBSERVER_DEBUG=1` dumps every raw stdin line to stderr (surfaced in the
     gateway log as `Process hook stderr hook=os-server-observer`) — used to verify
     the field names above.

2. **Registration.** PicoClaw does **not** scan a hooks dir; a hook is registered
   by a `config.json` entry under `hooks.processes.<name>`, gated by BOTH the global
   `hooks.enabled` AND the **per-process `enabled`** (both default false — same shape
   as the `tools.mcp` global + per-server gate; without the per-process `enabled`
   PicoClaw silently never spawns the subprocess). So `ensureObserverHook()` (called
   from `EnsureOnboarding`) does two writes: materializes `observer.py` to
   `/root/.picoclaw/hooks/os-server-observer/` with the `__OS_SERVER_TURN_URL__`
   placeholder substituted, and upserts:

   ```json
   "hooks": { "enabled": true, "processes": { "os-server-observer": {
     "enabled": true,
     "transport": "stdio",
     "command": ["python3", "/root/.picoclaw/hooks/os-server-observer/observer.py"],
     "env": { "OS_SERVER_TURN_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:<HttpPort>/api/agent/channel-turn", "OBSERVER_DEBUG": "1" },
     "observe": ["turn_start", "turn_end"]
   } } }
   ```

   It is idempotent (script diff + config-marshal diff) and returns `changed`;
   `EnsureOnboarding` restarts the gateway only when something changed, since the
   gateway loads hooks only at start. The config write is serialized under the same
   `mcpMu` that guards `config.json` (see `mcp.go`).

## 8. What is stubbed

Everything not on the PicoClaw hot path is a no-op so the single
`domain.AgentGateway` interface is satisfied without inventing features the
backend does not have: `SetupAgent`, WhatsApp pairing,
`RefreshModelsConfig`, `FetchChatHistory`, `CompactSession`,
the model watchers (`StartModelSync`/`StartPrimaryModelWatch`), `UpdatePrimaryModel`.
The error-returning stubs (`RefreshModelsConfig`, `UpdatePrimaryModel`,
`CompactSession`) return `domain.ErrNotSupportedByRuntime` — never `nil` — so
callers can tell "nothing to apply" from "applied" (see
[`adding-agent-runtime.md`](adding-agent-runtime.md) §4 "No fake success").
(`AddChannel` / `RefreshChannelConfig` are NOT stubs — they return
`domain.ErrChannelNotSupported` for unsupported channels, see §7; `EnsureOnboarding`
(§1.1) and `StartSkillWatcher` (skill auto-update, §1.1) are real.) These are also
real, not stubs: `RestartAgent` (restarts the `picoclaw` systemd unit via
`restartPicoclawGateway`), `ResetAgent` (factory-reset wipe — see §8.2),
`GetConfigJSON` (returns `/root/.picoclaw/config.json` —
the structure file; secrets in `.security.yml` are never exposed),
`WriteMCPEntry` / `RemoveMCPEntry` (MCP connectors — see §8.1), and
`WatchIdentity` / `UpdateIdentityName` (`identity.go`) — PicoClaw's `IDENTITY.md` is
a 1-for-1 copy of OpenClaw's, so the `**Name:**` card line is watched (→ wake words)
and rewritten exactly as on OpenClaw.
HAL TTS/voice, Telegram fan-out, sensing-event queue/drain, and the run-marker
helpers (guard / broadcast / web-chat / silent / pose-bucket) are backend-agnostic
and behave exactly like the Hermes backend.

These stay no-ops **on purpose**: PicoClaw is provisioned out-of-process by
`install.sh` + `presync.sh` (§1.1), not by in-process gateway calls. Install,
model/channel config, and persona migration all happen in those scripts during the
`switch-runtime` flow. The one exception is **`EnsureOnboarding`**
(`onboarding.go`), which is real: it injects the OS-managed block into
`workspace/AGENTS.md` on boot/config-change (§1.1), the same contract openclaw has.

### 8.1 MCP connectors (`mcp.go`)

`WriteMCPEntry` / `RemoveMCPEntry` wire remote-MCP connectors (the `connector.set`
MQTT flow — Notion, Asana, Linear, GitHub, Ahrefs, Figma) into PicoClaw's
`config.json`. They are the same shared callers OpenClaw/Hermes use; only the on-disk
shape differs, and PicoClaw's differs in two ways that `mcp.go` handles:

1. **Nesting.** PicoClaw servers live under **`tools.mcp.servers.<name>`**, not a
   top-level `mcp.servers` (OpenClaw) or `mcp_servers` (Hermes) map. `applyMCPServerWrite`
   creates the `tools` → `mcp` → `servers` chain if absent.
2. **Global gate.** `tools.mcp.enabled` defaults to **`false`** — a server written
   under a disabled block is silently ignored. `WriteMCPEntry` asserts it `true`.

The incoming OpenClaw-shaped entry (`{type:"http", url, headers}` for hosted MCP,
`{command, args, env}` for stdio) is passed through with **`enabled: true`** asserted
(PicoClaw's per-server flag). The `type` key is **kept verbatim** — PicoClaw's
transport values (`stdio` / `sse` / `http`) already match, and an explicit
`type:"http"` avoids PicoClaw's empty-type→`sse` inference. `RemoveMCPEntry` deletes
the named server (idempotent — `removed=false`, no restart, when absent) and leaves
`tools.mcp.enabled` on so other wired servers keep loading. Both paths write
`config.json` atomically (temp + rename, no chown — PicoClaw runs as root) under
`mcpMu`, then `restartPicoclawGateway`. Secrets in `.security.yml` are never touched.

### 8.2 Factory reset (`reset.go`)

`ResetAgent` is the PicoClaw factory-reset wipe, called by
`server/system/factoryreset.go` on the active gateway. Unlike OpenClaw (which keeps
`identity/` + `device-key.json` and lets `SetupAgent` recreate `openclaw.json`) and
Hermes (which resets `config.yaml`/`.env` in place and preserves `SOUL.md`),
**PicoClaw preserves nothing**: its `config.json` + `.security.yml` are regenerated
from the project `/root/config/config.json` by `presync.sh` on the next switch, so
the reset wipes `/root/.picoclaw` **wholesale** and re-onboards a clean baseline.

`wipePicoclawState()` runs four steps:

1. **`systemctl stop picoclaw` + verify** — the gateway's systemd unit (written by
   `install.sh`) sets `WorkingDirectory=/root/.picoclaw` and `Restart=always`, so it
   holds the data dir open and would recreate files under it. An explicit stop
   overrides `Restart=always` (it is not a crash), so the gateway stays down while we
   wipe. `waitForPicoclawStop` polls `is-active` for up to 5s.
2. **`systemctl disable picoclaw`** — a factory reset also wipes `/root/config/config.json`
   and reboots into the **default (openclaw)** runtime, so PicoClaw must NOT auto-start.
   `switch-runtime` re-enables it only when the user switches back.
3. **`rm -rf /root/.picoclaw`** — config, `.security.yml`, workspace (persona/memory/
   skills), sessions, and the **`.openclaw-migrated` marker** (so `presync.sh` §0
   re-migrates persona/memory from OpenClaw on the next switch).
4. **`picoclaw onboard`** (`HOME=/root`) — recreate a valid baseline (workspace +
   baseline `config.json`/`.security.yml`). Non-fatal: the config is not correct until
   `presync.sh` re-asserts the real model/channel wiring on the next switch, and
   `install.sh` also onboards when `config.json` is absent, so a failure self-heals.

The gateway is left **stopped + disabled** — the post-reboot setup wizard runs the
default runtime's `SetupAgent`, mirroring how OpenClaw/Hermes disable their own unit
in `ResetAgent`.
