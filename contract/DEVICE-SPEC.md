# DEVICE.md Specification — `autonomous.device.v1`

`DEVICE.md` is the contract that describes a physical body to the Autonomous OS, the
agentic gateway, and skills. It is the device-side equivalent of `SKILL.md`: the YAML
front matter is the machine contract the runtime parses at boot; the prose below is
guidance the gateway and contributors read.

One file per device at `devices/<id>/DEVICE.md`. **Adding a device is writing a
`DEVICE.md`** (plus any missing drivers) — never a fork.

## How the OS consumes it

At boot the runtime reads the front matter and:

0. **Validates `schema`** — a missing, malformed, or unknown-major tag (e.g.
   `autonomous.device.v2` on a runtime that only understands `v1`) aborts boot.
   The runtime refuses to mount a body against an ABI it cannot read.
0b. **Verifies the `boards` gate** — resolves the physical board and aborts if it
   is unidentifiable or not in `boards`. Wrong board means wrong pin maps, a
   hardware fault, not a configuration choice.
0c. **Checks `id` against the folder** — `id` must equal the directory the
   profile is mounted from; a mismatch is a misplaced or mistyped profile and
   aborts boot. `id`/`name`/`type` are then exposed via HAL `GET /device`.
1. Brings up **only** the capability subsystems the device declares.
2. **Skips** undeclared capabilities silently — that is a different device, by design.
3. **Fails loudly** if a *declared* capability's driver is missing or won't initialize —
   that is a hardware fault, not a configuration choice.

This single rule is what turns "Intern" into "Lamp minus `motion` and `display`"
instead of a fork: the only difference between two devices is which capabilities they
declare. It replaces the old implicit `try/except ImportError` skip, which couldn't
tell "no servo by design" from "servo lib missing" from "servo broken."

## Front matter schema (v1)

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `schema` | yes | Contract version. `autonomous.device.v1`. |
| `id` | yes | Stable device id. **Must equal the device folder name** (`devices/<id>/`); the runtime aborts boot on a mismatch. |
| `name` | yes | Display name. Exposed via HAL `GET /device`. |
| `type` | yes | Free-form class (`desk_robot`, `desk_agent`). Exposed via HAL `GET /device`. |
| `boards` | yes | Supported boards. At boot the runtime resolves the physical board (`os/hal/board`) and aborts if it is unknown or not in this list. |
| `gateway` | yes | Default agentic gateway (`default`) + wire transport (`protocol`). The transport follows from the runtime (openclaw→websocket, hermes→sse); `protocol` is validated for consistency against `default` (a warning, not a driver). |
| `capabilities` | yes | Map of capability group → declaration (below). |
| `soul_ref` | no | Soul artifact for this body: a path read relative to the device folder (e.g. `SOUL.md`), or an `http(s)://` URL the runtime downloads. Absent → the gateway's default soul. |
| `safety_ref` | no | The device's safety document: a path read relative to the device folder (e.g. `SAFETY.md`), or an `http(s)://` URL downloaded. Today it only feeds the per-capability anchor-consistency check (a warning); enforcement is a future engine. |
| `memory` | no | Memory backend declaration (`{ backend: <name> }`). Informational — the brain owns memory today; surfaced via HAL `GET /device`, not gated. |

### Capability declaration

Each entry under `capabilities` is a group from `contract/capabilities.md`:

```yaml
capabilities:
  motion:
    routes: [servo]           # HAL routes this group mounts
    driver: feetech           # implementation family — informational, surfaced
                              # via GET /device; NOT gated (the route is the
                              # contract, the driver behind it churns freely)
    required: false           # if true, a missing driver is a boot failure
    safety: SAFETY.md#motion  # bounds that govern this capability
```

`required: true` means "this device is not itself without this capability." Audio is
`required` on both Lamp and Intern; motion is `required` on neither.

## Versioning — the frozen contract

`schema` is an ABI. Within a major version fields are only **added**, never removed or
repurposed — a `v1` `DEVICE.md` must keep booting on every later `v1` runtime. Breaking
changes bump to `autonomous.device.v2`, and the runtime supports both across a
deprecation window. The capability vocabulary in `contract/capabilities.md` follows the
same rule: **names are forever.**

This is the Autonomous equivalent of the Linux syscall ABI / Android API level — the
contract facing devices and skills is stable; the drivers behind it churn freely.
